forecast prepared meeting suggested growth economic activity would slow appreciably next several quarters dropping briefly rate increase economy potential output according staff analysis economy already operating long run capacity forecast assumed monetary policy would accommodate continuing tendency aggregate demand expand pace could foster sustained higher inflation growth consumer expenditures projected moderate next year spending consumer durables lost momentum context diminishing pent demands rise borrowing costs smaller gains income extended period rapid increases growth business fixed investment also expected slow appreciably partly reflecting less favorable financial conditions partly slower pace output growth homebuilding would damped higher financing costs though activity sector expected remain well depressed levels reached recent years economy operating close long run potential reduction core rate inflation anticipated forecast horizon consumer price inflation projected elevated near term pass ongoing run materials prices higher import prices settling committee discussion current prospective economic conditions members commented continuing indications robust expansion business activity output near maximum sustainable levels still viewed significant slowing pace expansion reasonable expectation though acknowledged signs slowing currently limited particular recent data indicated greater probability somewhat strength aggregate demand appeared developing late spring early summer policy tightening actions implemented earlier year seemed elicited mild response thus far interest sensitive sectors economy however much retarding effects actions including recent sizable tightening august probably yet felt economy light strength aggregate demand lags effects policy risks rise inflation rates probably increased large rise might might reversed difficult predict point however indications persisting pickup inflation would matter considerable concern developments would need monitored special care light committee longstanding commitment containing inflation moving time toward price stability foster maximum sustainable performance economy review developments across nation members commented high levels business activity many regions many referred increasing reports scarcities specific types labor resources softening earlier many areas business conditions appeared strengthened number regions recent weeks displaying little change continued moderate growth elsewhere robust expansion manufacturing activity especially motor vehicle related industries notable feature recent business developments financial side overall expansion credit remained moderate many members stressed ready availability financing increasingly aggressive bank lenders moreover despite higher interest rates capital markets providing continued support wide variety borrowers constraints availability credit reluctance many borrowers incur new debt factors tended retard recovery earlier stages given way financial climate might even providing extra impetus spending regard outlook activity key sectors economy consumer spending buoyant expected recent months members saw spending likely reasonably well maintained moderation growth quarters ahead seemed likely however pent demands increasingly satisfied housing related purchases consumer durables tended moderate members cited anecdotal evidence fairly brisk retail sales many areas recently associated optimism among retail business contacts recent survey results indicated consumer sentiment remained favorable sales motor vehicles expected continue improvement noted august supply shortages met increased production business fixed investment viewed likely rise substantially next several quarters rate growth moderating year probably would diminish conjunction projected slowing overall demand expansion expenditures business equipment slowed considerably year extremely rapid rate 1993 could expected moderate somewhat time nonresidential construction slowly trending higher firms facing capacity constraints sought expand production facilities prospects inventory investment remained key uncertainty outlook developments sector could well important bearing extent anticipated slowing expansion overall economic activity next quarters surge inventory investment second quarter clearly unsustainable members questioned whether expected cutback inventory accumulation would sizable near term continuing strength new orders anecdotal reports point desire reduce inventories suggested much second quarter buildup probably intended indeed context increasing backlogs lagging deliveries pointed growing capacity constraints many business firms might seek build safety stocks avoid supply disruptions would interfere production schedules time trend toward time inventory management even temporarily arrested safety stocks increased would help limit potentially excessive buildup inventories would present threat later sustainability expansion members cited anecdotal evidence tending support statistical indications weakening housing markets

increasing capacity constraints face recent growth overall demand pace economy long run potential perspective future path inflation would depend importantly extent expansion overall activity would fact abate unsustainable pace members expressed particular concern trend growth moderate soon existing inflationary pressures inflationary expectations would quickly become pronounced inflation would gather momentum thus far however price pressures remained concentrated early stages production evidenced broad measures prices anecdotal information obtained numerous business contacts pass higher

wage increases also might reflect measure shift price wage setting behavior attributable credibility committee anti inflationary stance recent years number members commented sluggish moderate growth wide variety money credit measures provided assurance date monetary policy laid basis sustained upturn inflation nonetheless members concluded potential additional inflation remained substantial monetary policy standpoint rendered especially urgent ongoing assessment inflation trends committee discussion policy period ahead members agreed desirability maintaining steady policy course least near term light appreciable tightening policy approved august members anticipated policy change likely required period juncture generally continued feel recent evidence warrant immediate tightening even ongoing inflow information performance economy continued indicate significant potential higher inflation road many members suggested additional monetary restraint could well needed time key uncertainty regard related restraining effects policy moves implemented earlier year actions appeared exerted less restraint date anticipated appreciable lagged effects actions indeed perhaps large part effects could still expected time extremely difficult evaluate whether earlier tightening moves exerting lesser effect usual simply delayed whether members might misjudged underlying strength expansion view many members information would become available intermeeting period provide firmer basis judging course economy risks greater inflation incoming information point greater likelihood price pressures would intensify committee would need act promptly forcefully avert upward ratcheting inflationary expectations actual inflation would difficult reverse consequently views differed regard likely need policy tightening weeks immediately ahead members generally supported shift symmetry august directive asymmetry toward restraint members indicated could accept asymmetric directive expressed misgivings use instruction directive felt subject misunderstanding financial markets could add uncertainty committee intentions one member favored immediate move somewhat greater reserve restraint available evidence view already suggested upturn inflationary expectations prospect significant rise inflation course committee discussion number members commented behavior monetary credit aggregates taken account evaluation current stance monetary policy various money related measures many years proved unreliable greater lesser extent gauging economic prospects weak growth wide array measures could entirely disregarded possible indicator degree monetary restraint argued caution implementing policy tightening one member noted however slow growth narrow measures reserves money followed extended period rapid expansion recent weakness might indicative constrained liquidity point moreover ready availability bank credit receptivity financial markets generally argued many borrowers including small medium size businesses currently access ample financing conclusion committee discussion one members indicated could support directive called maintaining existing degree
