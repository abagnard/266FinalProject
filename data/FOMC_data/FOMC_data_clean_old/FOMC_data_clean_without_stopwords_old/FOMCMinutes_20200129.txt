discussion focused two topics potential interactions monetary policy financial stability potential use inflation ranges around committee 2 percent inflation objective staff briefing first topic noted current environment low neutral rates achieving committee dual mandate goals maximum employment price stability would require low policy rates frequently regardless monetary policy strategy tools chosen consequently policy strategies tools help support stronger economy anchor inflation expectations level consistent committee objective low neutral rate environment help promote financial stability addition staff reported available empirical evidence suggests effects changes policy rates asset prices risk premiums tend modest relative historical fluctuations measures however may circumstances persistently accommodative policy stance otherwise consistent dual mandate goals may contribute increase financial system vulnerabilities including increased borrowing financial leverage valuation pressures staff noted clear communications committee ongoing assessments interactions monetary policy financial stability could help avoid large interest rate surprises could otherwise contribute financial vulnerabilities briefing concluded short review central banks approached issue including use financial instability escape clauses provide leeway central bank deviate usual monetary policy strategy financial vulnerabilities become significant discussion effects alternative monetary policy strategies tools might financial stability participants noted macroeconomic stability achievement committee dual mandate depended stable financial system unstable financial system may amplify shocks economy exacerbate increases unemployment drive inflation away committee goal respect relationship monetary policy financial stability participants noted evidence regarding link policy stance elevated financial vulnerabilities limited couple participants observing many episodes persistently low interest rates addition past episodes heightened financial vulnerabilities associated excessive risk taking behavior seem responsive typical changes interest rates number participants judged circumstances low policy rates might help foster financial stability provided needed support strong economic conditions price stability participants remarked however keeping policy rates low achieve committee dual mandate objectives may contribute buildup financial vulnerabilities especially times economy full employment development could pose future risks economy ability committee achieve dual mandate participants discussed financial stability considerations incorporated conduct monetary policy generally agreed supervisory regulatory macroprudential tools primary means address financial stability risks participants commented especially case addressing risks associated structural features current low level neutral interest rates number participants noted countercyclical macroprudential tools countercyclical capital buffer could used address cyclical financial stability risks however various participants noted tools could deployed proactively lean buildup financial vulnerabilities limitations context u financial system available tools part designed address vulnerabilities outside banking sector addition tools within authority committee use requires coordination prudential regulators recognizing limitations many participants remarked committee rule possibility adjusting stance monetary policy mitigate financial stability risks particularly risks important implications economic outlook macroprudential tools likely ineffective mitigating risks nevertheless many participants noted current knowledge interactions stance monetary policy financial vulnerabilities imprecise warrant systematically adjusting monetary policy response evolution financial stability risks result monetary policy guided primarily outlook employment inflation respond financial stability risks insofar risks significantly threaten achievement committee mandate several participants observed monetary policy measures needed curb financial stability risks could quite large resulting effects employment inflation could place high hurdle measures participants remarked financial stability risks consideration achieving committee dual mandate clear communications strategy would needed convey committee assessments financial vulnerabilities potential implications monetary policy outlook several participants noted communications strategy could include possible use financial instability escape clauses help explain rationale policy actions buildup financial vulnerabilities poses risks achievement committee goals staff briefing considerations regarding use inflation range focused three different concepts inflation range first uncertainty range could communicate magnitude inherent variability inflation would still consistent achieving committee symmetric inflation objective second operational range could signal conditions committee would prefer inflation away longer run objective time range could potentially used part makeup policy strategy including one based average inflation targeting strategies aimed offsetting adverse effects binding effective lower bound policy rates third indifference range could communicate monetary policy would respond deviations inflation within range briefing also summarized experiences foreign central banks use inflation ranges ranges typically put place many years ago often conjunction adopting inflation target staff highlighted communications challenges could arise inflation range introduced time inflation running central bank objective number years environment introduction symmetric range around point objective could misinterpreted sign central bank concerned inflation remaining stated goal situation could lead inflation expectations drifting lower end range participants expressed range views potential benefits costs different types inflation ranges participants expressed concern introducing symmetric inflation range around 2 percent objective following extended period inflation mostly running somewhat 2 percent could misperceived signal committee comfortable continued misses symmetric inflation objective many participants agreed uncertainty range could misinterpreted indifference range hence lack commitment committee symmetric 2 percent inflation objective participants suggested clear introducing range would help much achieving committee inflation objective noted introducing range could make objective less clear public instead establishing range committee could continue communicate inflation objective symmetric around 2 percent inflation inherently variable committee could emphasize intention inflation centered 2 percent objective nevertheless view inherent variability inflation several participants judged could benefit communicating inflation objective symmetric range around point target addition participants suggested inflation range could convey uncertainty associated available array inflation measures committee communications could explicitly reference measures inflation several participants also stated employing asymmetric operational range time 2 percent near lower end range still maintaining longer run target 2 percent could help communicate committee intended inflation average 2 percent time turn could help keep longer run inflation expectations levels consistent objective participants expected upcoming meetings would continue
