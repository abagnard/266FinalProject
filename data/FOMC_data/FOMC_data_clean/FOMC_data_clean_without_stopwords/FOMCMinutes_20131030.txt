planning introductory briefing staff meeting participants wide ranging discussion topics related path monetary policy medium term including strategic communication issues associated committee asset purchase program well possibilities clarifying strengthening forward guidance federal funds rate context participants discussed financial market response committee decisions june september meetings generally complexities associated communications committee current policy tools number participants noted recent movements interest rates indicators suggested financial markets viewed committee tools asset purchases forward guidance regarding federal funds rate closely linked one possible explanation view inference part investors change asset purchases reflected change committee outlook economy would associated adjustments purchase program expected path policy rates another perspective change asset purchases would read providing information willingness committee pursue economic objectives tools couple participants observed decision september fomc meeting might strengthened credibility monetary policy suggested downward shift expected path short term interest rates brought path closely alignment committee forward guidance participants broadly endorsed making committee communications simple clear consistent possible discussed ways regard asset purchase program one suggestion repeat set principles public communications example participants could emphasize program data dependent reduction pace purchases would depend cumulative progress labor markets since start program well outlook future gains continuing assessment efficacy costs asset purchases might lead committee decide point change mix policy tools maintaining high degree accommodation another suggestion enhancing communications use summary economic projections provide information participants views general discussion policy strategy tactics participants reviewed issues specific committee asset purchase program generally expected data would prove consistent committee outlook ongoing improvement labor market conditions would thus warrant trimming pace purchases coming months however participants also considered scenarios might stage appropriate begin wind program unambiguous improvement outlook apparent couple participants thought premature focus latter eventuality observing purchase program effective time needed assess outlook labor market inflation moreover international comparisons suggested federal reserve balance sheet retained ample capacity relative scale u economy nonetheless participants noted committee going contemplate cutting purchases future based criteria improvement labor market outlook concerns efficacy costs asset purchases would need communicate effectively criteria circumstances might well appropriate offset effects reduced purchases undertaking alternative actions provide accommodation time participants generally expressed reservations possibility introducing simple mechanical rule would adjust pace asset purchases automatically based single variable unemployment rate payroll employment open considering rule others viewed approach unlikely reliably produce appropriate policy outcomes alternative participants mentioned might preferable adopt even simpler plan announce total size remaining purchases timetable winding program calendar based step would run counter data dependent state contingent nature current asset purchase program would easier communicate might help public separate committee purchase program policy federal funds rate overall stance policy regard future reductions asset purchases participants discussed might split across asset classes number participants believed making roughly equal adjustments purchases treasury securities mbs would appropriate relatively straightforward communicate public however others indicated could back trimming pace treasury purchases rapidly mbs perhaps signal intention support mortgage markets one participant thought trimming mbs first would reduce potential distortions credit allocation part planning discussion participants also examined several possibilities clarifying strengthening forward guidance federal funds rate including providing additional information likely path rate either one economic thresholds current guidance reached funds rate target eventually raised current exceptionally low level couple participants favored simply reducing 6 1 2 percent unemployment rate threshold others noted change might raise concerns durability committee commitment thresholds participants also weighed merits stating even unemployment rate dropped 6 1 2 percent target federal funds rate would raised long inflation rate projected run given level general benefits adding kind quantitative floor inflation viewed uncertain likely rather modest communicating could present challenges participants remained favorably inclined toward several participants concluded providing additional qualitative information committee intentions regarding federal funds rate unemployment threshold reached could helpful guidance could indicate range information committee would consider evaluating would appropriate raise federal funds rate alternatively policy statement could indicate even first increase federal funds rate target committee anticipated keeping rate longer run equilibrium value time economic headwinds likely diminish slowly factors besides headwinds also mentioned possibly providing rationale maintaining low trajectory federal funds rate including following commitment support economy maintaining accommodative policy longer modifications forward guidance federal funds rate could implemented future either improve clarity add policy accommodation perhaps conjunction reduction pace asset purchases part rebalancing committee tools participants also discussed range possible actions could considered committee wished signal intention keep short term rates low reinforce forward guidance federal funds rate example participants thought reduction board governors interest rate paid excess reserves could worth considering stage although benefits step generally seen likely small except possibly signal policy intentions contrast participants expressed range concerns using open market operations aimed affecting expected path short term interest rates standing purchase facility shorter term treasury securities provision term funding repurchase agreements among concerns voiced operations would inhibit price discovery remove valuable
