world influence heightened job insecurity wages prices another possible effect future wage demands lower inflation expectations prevailed although member saw greater inflation high probability several refer risks direction including possibility greater pressures resources stemming faster currently anticipated economic growth committee discussion policy intermeeting period ahead members either favored could accept slight easing degree pressure reserve positions one argument cited favor easing policy stance indexed prevailing real federal funds rate becoming somewhat restrictive inflation inflationary expectations moderated leaving real short term rates higher anticipated addition markets expecting reduction federal funds rate coming months unchanged policy likely lead backup intermediate long term rates although sign cumulative deterioration economic performance get way downside risks expansion appeared increased modest easing would better position policy guard possibility longer term expansion would begin fall short economy potential especially fiscal policy likely least moderately restrictive case recent slowing economic expansion combined wage price restraint evident current levels resource utilization continuing business efforts expand capacity suggested little risk pickup inflation indeed favorable inflation experience last half year raised possibility continued modest price improvement number members though willing accept slight easing preferred unchanged policy stance inflation slowed elevated pace observed early part year little hard evidence indicate would decline forecast horizon significant increase sustainable growth rate economy members also expressed concern possible repercussions financial markets easing action would follow already strong rally bond stock prices circumstances members questioned whether somewhat easier policy stance would prove consistent committee objective fostering progress toward price stability moreover although available evidence economy current performance remained mixed moderation economic growth third quarter surge seem time signal growing shortfall economy potential instead economy likely view continue grow generally acceptable rate near capacity members saw potential somewhat faster growth pace time could intensify inflationary pressures accordingly preferred wait evidence
