context moderation growth final demand accounted considerable portion overall expansion gdp reported second quarter rate inventory accumulation could expected slow current quarter extent slowing retarding effects near term economic growth uncertain partly basis anecdotal reports members concluded much inventory buildup second quarter voluntary thereby reducing probability sharp reversal indeed degree delivery lead times might edge various industries capacity constraints encountered stronger efforts build inventories could emerge especially background currently low inventory sales ratios business contacts reported planning add inventories months ahead time ongoing business efforts maintain relatively lean inventories undoubtedly would tend limit broad buildup inventories regard outlook residential construction members reported slowing single family housing demand many parts country homebuyers reacted rise mortgage interest rates however single family homebuilding activity maintained relatively robust levels areas multifamily housing construction improving numerous local markets balance housing sector probably would contribute little impetus expansion homebuilding

extent remaining margins available resources part uncertainty effects capacity ongoing efforts improve productivity business restructurings sharp increases business investment expenditures despite somewhat differing views members generally concluded economy probably operating level quite close already long run potential circumstances many members commented risks intensifying inflation clearly upside economic expansion moderate pace recent quarters indications accelerating cost price pressures yet visible broad measures inflation wages measures subject fluctuations largely associated swings food energy prices displayed discernible trend past several quarters time signs increasing prices costs earlier stages production appeared multiplying including sizable price increases wide range industrial commodities generally members cited growing number reports business firms rising input costs successful efforts firms raise prices also noted decline value dollar would contribute directly indirectly upward pressures prices however business contacts notably retail level indicated competition remained intense made difficult pass cost increases higher prices thereby placing premium continued efforts contain costs improvements productivity differing perspective one member noted decelerating growth money measures ml monetary base reserves expanding rapidly several years implied monetary policy moved substantially curtail increase inflation pressures though action might still required committee discussion policy intermeeting period ahead members agreed prompt tightening move needed provide greater assurance inflationary pressures economy would remain subdued members recognized committee earlier policy actions exerting restraining effects lagged effects actions could

disposition part board governors approve 1 2 percentage point increase discount rate pending several federal reserve banks committee members endorsed proposal allow effects rise discount rate approved reflected fully reserve markets consideration given lesser adjustment reserve conditions members concluded smaller step unlikely adequate perceiving financial markets would quickly build monetary tightening unknown size timing would add market uncertainty volatility decisive policy move might reduce need tightening later possibly even avert need entirely moderating arresting inflationary momentum economy promptly helping curb inflationary expectations effectively considering possible adjustments policy period next meeting members favored moving symmetric intermeeting instruction
