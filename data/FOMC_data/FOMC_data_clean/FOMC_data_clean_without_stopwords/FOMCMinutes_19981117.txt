complete policy adjustment changed economic financial climate emerged since midsummer would provide insurance unexpectedly severe weakening expansion members saw little risk modest easing would ignite inflationary pressures economy given subdued behavior inflation outlook economic activity moreover easing could readily reversed unexpected circumstances call action view risks inaction greater terms potential financial consequences also could materialize much sooner risks stimulating greater inflation slight easing contemplated members indicated light continued robust economic growth tight labor markets improving financial conditions preference awaiting developments might provide stronger basis easing action members expressed concern easier reserve conditions would accommodate step monetary growth already quite rapid potentially inflationary consequences later nonetheless one members could endorse decision ease given evident downside risks international situation financial market
