remaining slack resource markets discussion current conditions economic outlook many participants said circumstances changed anticipated time committee meeting early february particular incoming data anecdotal information indicated economic activity appreciably forward momentum previously perceived inflation pressures could intensifying underlying inflation appeared moved modestly nearly participants thought core total inflation going forward would relatively low become less certain outlook next quarters many participants noted recent data business commentary indicated investment running considerably stronger first quarter year previously anticipated underlying trends capital spending appeared robust earlier recognized perhaps partly response unusually supportive financial conditions strength thought likely carry forward business contacts confident economic prospects confidence bolstering firms willingness invest anecdotal information suggested firms investing part expand capacity part boost productivity lower costs investment prompted need replace equipment becoming obsolete part higher level energy prices increased demand reported wide variety categories capital goods ranging several types heavy equipment including trucks farm machinery construction equipment software high tech equipment nonresidential construction however remained soft many regions damped relatively high vacancy rates office buildings commercial real estate spending housing consumer goods services also seen underpinning economic expansion single family housing starts record

meeting participants perceived slack labor markets gradually diminishing general business executives indicated labor readily available although workers certain skills certain occupations trucking becoming increasingly difficult hire commented failure labor force participation rise expected expansion gained momentum likely portended somewhat weaker labor force growth previously anticipated development margin would tend reduce expansion potential output still pressures prices stemming labor costs seemed well contained expected remain damped coming quarters national data anecdotal information suggested wages generally continued increase moderately however health care expenses persistent source pressure costs growth unit labor costs continued held growth output per hour worked continued perform surprisingly well although productivity growth slowed extraordinarily rapid pace prevailed earlier expansion data fourth quarter 2004 well preliminary indications first quarter year suggested gains efficiency remained substantial participants remarked many business executives seeking advances productivity organizational improvements well investment equipment software regarding latter evidence suggested rapid technological progress sustained would continue drive cost many forms productive capital thus boost returns investment moreover stronger picture capital spending emerged late boded well performance productivity going forward still considerable uncertainty persisted longer run prospects productivity growth unit labor costs cost pressures profits prices meeting

earlier stages production well sizable increase energy prices nonetheless many participants stated expected total inflation diminish rise core consumer inflation limited one source upward pressure inflation rise energy prices seemed reasonable expect prices would level even decline mildly built futures prices unit labor costs still held moderate wage growth rising productivity indeed saw

contracts delivery well future suggested significant unwinding higher energy costs might prospect several participants indicated current circumstances viewed upside surprise inflation potentially harmful equivalent downside surprise partly outcome could well impart additional upward momentum inflation expectations committee discussion monetary policy intermeeting period members favored boosting target federal funds rate 25 basis points 2 3 4 percent meeting monetary conditions evidently still quite accommodative economic activity appeared momentum previously perceived core inflation probably would stay low pressures inflation seemed risen prospects legislative action apply significant fiscal restraint unclear even expansion became increasingly well established private demand proved strong resilient although required amount cumulative tightening may increased members noted accelerated pace policy tightening appear necessary time degree economic slack apparently remained productivity growth would probably continue damp increases unit labor costs prices inflation would likely continue contained circumstances committee members judged measured removal policy accommodation appropriate discussing announcement released meeting members agreed appropriate acknowledge recent evolution inflation situation indicating though longer term inflation expectations remain well contained pressures inflation picked recent months pricing power evident rise energy prices however notably fed core consumer prices regarding risks sustainable growth price stability members discussed proposal make committee assessment explicitly conditional assumption appropriate monetary policy underscore maintaining balanced risks would require policy action noted committee assessment balanced risks past nine months period monetary policy steadily tightened necessarily interpreted based implicitly assumption policy accommodation would removed number members believed formulaic language nature rigid reflect evolving economic circumstances satisfactory manner especially developments subtle complex members believed risk assessment discontinued members ultimately approved making risk assessment policy announcement following meeting explicitly conditional appropriate policy members also focused issue whether reiterate judgment expressed committee recent statements policy accommodation removed pace likely measured expressed view language could constrain future policy inappropriately concerns new felt pressing odds committee might need step pace policy firming thought increased members noted however existing measured pace language clearly conditional economy evolving way promised gradual return high levels resource utilization inflation remaining low thus believed wording rule either picking pace firming pausing process removing policy accommodation circumstances warrant also noted language precluded notable increase medium longer term interest rates intermeeting period markets extended expected gradual increase policy rates discomfort expressed language related explicitly likely trajectory future policy action also averred committee extent possible provide information would help public anticipate probable course monetary policy providing information would tend increase effectiveness monetary policy generally members recognized committee statement would need evolve time conclusion discussion committee voted authorize direct federal reserve bank new york instructed otherwise execute transactions system account
