for immediate release share the FOMC decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 2 percent recent information indicates that overall economic activity continues to expand partly reflecting some firming in household spending however labor markets have softened further and financial markets remain under considerable stress tight credit conditions the ongoing housing contraction and the rise in energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters the FOMC expects inflation to moderate later this year and next year however in light of the continued increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities and the elevated state of some indicators of inflation expectations uncertainty about the inflation outlook remains high the substantial easing of monetary policy to date combined with ongoing measures to foster market liquidity should help to promote moderate growth over time although downside risks to growth remain they appear to have diminished somewhat and the upside risks to inflation and inflation expectations have increased the FOMC will continue to monitor economic and financial developments and will act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability
