continue provide key support moderate expansion overall economic activity particular jobs incomes continued post sizable gains large increases stock market prices raised wealth income ratios sharply consumer optimism risen new highs hand accumulation consumer durables occurred course current cyclical advance likely exert retarding influence rise consumer spending somewhat restraining factors included prospect softening housing demand related purchases household goods already heavy debt repayment burdens many consumers members also noted possible correction currently elevated levels stock market prices could adverse effects consumer sentiment purchasing power balance growth personal consumer expenditures seen likely approximate moderate rate increase projected overall domestic demand members viewed prospects growth business fixed investment another important supportive factor outlook sustained economic expansion current indicators pointed continuation rapid growth spending near
