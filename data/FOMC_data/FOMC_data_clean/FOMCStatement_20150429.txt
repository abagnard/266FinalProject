information received since the FOMC met in march suggests that economic growth slowed during the winter months in part reflecting transitory factors the pace of job gains moderated and the unemployment rate remained steady a range of labor market indicators suggests that underutilization of labor resources was little changed growth in household spending declined households real incomes rose strongly partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and consumer sentiment remains high business fixed investment softened the recovery in the housing sector remained slow and exports declined inflation continued to run below the FOMC s longer run objective partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and decreasing prices of non energy imports market based measures of inflation compensation remain low survey based measures of longer term inflation expectations have remained stable consistent with its statutory mandate the FOMC seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability although growth in output and employment slowed during the first quarter the FOMC continues to expect that with appropriate policy accommodation economic activity will expand at a moderate pace with labor market indicators continuing to move toward levels the FOMC judges consistent with its dual mandate the FOMC continues to see the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced inflation is anticipated to remain near its recent low level in the near term but the FOMC expects inflation to rise gradually toward 2 percent over the medium term as the labor market improves further and the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices dissipate the FOMC continues to monitor inflation developments closely to support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability the FOMC today reaffirmed its view that the current 0 to 1 4 percent target range for the federal funds rate remains appropriate in determining how long to maintain this target range the FOMC will assess progress both realized and expected toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation this assessment will take into account a wide range of information including measures of labor market conditions indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations and readings on financial and international developments the FOMC anticipates that it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate when it has seen further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term the FOMC is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities in agency mortgage backed securities and of rolling over maturing treasury securities at auction this policy by keeping the FOMC s holdings of longer term securities at sizable levels should help maintain accommodative financial conditions when the FOMC decides to begin to remove policy accommodation it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent the FOMC currently anticipates that even after employment and inflation are near mandate consistent levels economic conditions may for some time warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the FOMC views as normal in the longer run
