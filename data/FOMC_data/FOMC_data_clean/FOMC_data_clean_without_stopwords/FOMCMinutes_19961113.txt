despite anticipated retrenchment inventory accumulation respect outlook inflation members emphasized despite widespread indications tight labor markets increase wages muted somewhat less anticipated broad evidence rising price inflation indeed many major measures inflation exhibited slight downtrend since 1993 looking ahead views differed extent regarding likely course inflation several members

extent rising cost pressures markets might passed higher prices statistical anecdotal information generally continued point tight labor markets somewhat faster rise labor compensation costs year even increases costs still falling short would anticipated basis historical experience similar labor market conditions moreover advance overall employment cost index third quarter perhaps understated extent appreciably expectations time business firms generally raising prices sufficiently compensate faster increases labor costs extent latter occurring evidently persistence intense competition markets indeed notable exception overall consumer price index rate inflation measured various broad price indexes tended ease marginally worst stabilize past two years prices farm commodities industrial materials declined considerably recently despite recent encouraging reports labor compensation prices members agreed risks rising inflation could dismissed several continued view slightly higher inflation likely inevitable prospect much would depend course strength economic expansion associated degree pressure resources notably labor markets appeared comparatively little slack relation producer resources suggested regard restrained increases labor compensation comparison historical experience probably transitory phenomenon though one could predict normal relationship would emerge related concern whether tightness labor markets would ease sufficiently quickly enough prevent inflation pressures escalating significantly members mentioned number favorable factors outlook inflation tended attenuate concerns reduced pressures food prices result better expected harvests improved supply conditions markets energy relatively restrained monetary growth recent months also cited development consistent subdued inflationary pressures moreover view advanced recent developments bond markets could read suggesting decrease inflationary expectations balance members expressed varying

surprisingly favorable inflationary developments suggested lower risks strengthening price pressures provided committee desirable opportunity pause observe developments bearing course economic activity inflation indeed extent inflation expectations declined recently short term interest rates changed little nominal terms edged higher real terms implying slightly greater monetary restraint reducing odds inflation would pick regard possible adjustments policy intermeeting period members indicated could support proposal retain current bias toward restraint several viewed bias desirable continued believe risks remained tilted least extent toward rising inflation time circumstances asymmetric directive would best reflect views even seemed likely intermeeting developments prompt policy tightening adjustment members commented shift symmetric directive might viewed consistent apparently diminished inflationary pressures agreed however shift would premature currently uncertain
