for immediate release the FOMC decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 3 1 4 percent the FOMC believes that even after this action the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity is providing ongoing support to economic activity although energy prices have risen further the expansion remains firm and labor market conditions continue to improve gradually pressures on inflation have stayed elevated but longer term inflation expectations remain well contained the FOMC perceives that with appropriate monetary policy action the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal with underlying inflation expected to be contained the FOMC believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured nonetheless the FOMC will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability
