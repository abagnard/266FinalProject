consistent opening small gap resource utilization near term cooling housing market lower motor vehicle production expected hold growth back time though significantly lower energy prices sustained

accelerating wages particularly certain types professionals skilled workers areas unskilled workers one participant highlighted staff forecast labor force growth would begin slow next years members baby boom generation retired even resource utilization rates unchanged slower growth labor force would mean increases employment would significantly lower average registered recent years case slower
