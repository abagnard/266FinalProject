currently scattered indications rapid increases wages evidence rising price inflation reasons underlying remarkable economic performance potentially transitory also possibly longer term nature lower

building activity appeared peaked areas oversupply apartments reported major cities generally rise mortgage rates since last fall softening demand indicators pointed less strength housing sector even outlook jobs income buildup financial wealth constituted favorable home affordability factors appeared likely support continuing high level housing demand especially single family sector relatively heavy spending imports owing strong domestic demand low prices likely would exert continuing negative effect net exports next several quarters nevertheless demand u exports could begin pick given

nation trading partners even foreign sector forecasts industrial well emerging market economies remained subject considerable downside risk including uncertainties stemming recent flare hostilities balkans committee discussion outlook inflation members commented saw evidence acceleration price inflation despite continuing strength economic expansion tightness labor markets anecdotal reports around nation continued underscore difficulty inability business firms raise prices highly competitive markets limited number reports relatively sizable increases wages paid workers skills especially short supply whole employers successful holding increases labor compensation offsetting improvements productivity indeed increases unit labor costs least nonfinancial corporate sector perhaps widely well declined low rate past year members saw little reason anticipate significant continuing increase inflation near term inflation expected rise owing recent hikes oil prices increase limited little evidence rising pressures prices early stages production nominal wages inflation remain contained time however members concerned risk sustained rapid growth aggregate demand would stretch markets even even presuming growth economic activity would moderate pace close economy potential labor markets would remain relatively taut point could trigger faster increases labor compensation turn rising price inflation moreover dissipation reversal favorable supply factors including example addition energy prices waning effects dollar earlier appreciation could contribute higher inflation expectations faster nominal compensation increases view others though impact prices unwinding favorable factors might well muted offset possible uptick productivity growth accelerating productivity spurring

forecasts recent years typically overstated rise inflation great deal uncertainty surrounded extent productivity gains factors unspecified might continue hold inflation period robust economic growth relatively tight labor markets committee discussion policy intermeeting period ahead members indicated favored unchanged policy stance several commented saw significant changes tenor recent statistical anecdotal reports would constitute basis adjustment policy greater presumption policy might need changed soon many referred particular absence warning signs accelerating inflation near term major consideration support steady policy time view however next policy action likely firming easing saw greater likelihood tight perhaps tightening labor markets would add price pressures demand would falter inflation would decrease yet recognized forecasts subject substantial degree uncertainty argued cautious approach policy change especially light economic performance conformed historical patterns recent years number members noted case might made unwinding part committee easing actions fall last year given recovery financial markets improvement economic outlook since argued incoming data prospects sustained favorable economic performance support action members concluded committee position wait developments unfold especially given absence evidence impending acceleration underlying inflation risks higher inflation intensified would still time take action head price pressures order foster sustained economic growth high level employment many members emphasized however circumstances committee might need act promptly forestall buildup inflationary forces could destabilize expansion members endorsed proposal retain existing symmetry directive respect possible adjustments policy intermeeting period many believed next policy move likely would direction tightening outcome foregone conclusion event timing next policy action highly uncertain also noted biased directive would consistent members view policy adjustment unlikely period ahead moreover committee disclosure procedures always require immediate announcement shift symmetry members agreed announce shift tightening bias would likely current circumstances relatively pronounced undesired effect financial markets particular markets might well build higher odds policy tightening move may june
