for immediate release share the FOMC decided today to lower its target for the federal funds rate 25 basis points to 4 1 2 percent economic growth was solid in the third quarter and strains in financial markets have eased somewhat on balance however the pace of economic expansion will likely slow in the near term partly reflecting the intensification of the housing correction today s action combined with the policy action taken in september should help forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy that might otherwise arise from the disruptions in financial markets and promote moderate growth over time readings on core inflation have improved modestly this year but recent increases in energy and commodity prices among other factors may put renewed upward pressure on inflation in this context the FOMC judges that some inflation risks remain and it will continue to monitor inflation developments carefully the FOMC judges that after this action the upside risks to inflation roughly balance the downside risks to growth the FOMC will continue to assess the effects of financial and other developments on economic prospects and will act as needed to foster price stability and sustainable economic growth
