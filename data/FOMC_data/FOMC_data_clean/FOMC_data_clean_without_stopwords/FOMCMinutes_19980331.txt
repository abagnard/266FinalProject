committee policy discussion preferred could accept proposal maintain unchanged policy stance also included shift current symmetrical directive asymmetrical directive tilted toward restraint members agreed strength economic expansion firming labor markets persist policy tightening likely would needed point head imbalances time would undermine expansion economic activity saw little urgency tighten

perhaps response disappointing growth business profits could adverse impact business consumer confidence circumstances preemptive policy move head rising inflation could prove premature perhaps even unwarranted indeed view tightening move inevitable moreover policy action currently anticipated commented tightening could produce outsized undesirable response financial markets balance light uncertainties outlook given variety special factors would continue contain inflation time committee could await developments bearing strength inflationary pressures without incurring significant risk disruptive policy actions would needed later response upturn inflation inflation expectations one member indicated strong preference immediate policy tightening move largely grounds current conditions relatively rapid growth money credit consistent continued progress toward reducing inflation number members also commented strength monetary aggregates especially persist suggesting ample liquidity accommodative financial conditions addition cited ebullient equity markets narrow risk spreads credit markets additional evidence financial conditions restraining final demands much factors would weigh evaluation need timing policy tightening move members agreed particularly sensitive developments might signal rising inflation pressures regard shift asymmetric directive seemed desirable directive would consistent committee judgment information become available since symmetric directive last adopted february altered inflation risks enough make tightening likely prospect distant future
