remained uncertain unclear juncture whether expansion would slow sufficiently contain pressures labor producer resources nonetheless broad measures price inflation adjusted exclude volatile food energy components exhibit uptrend despite robust growth economic activity year high levels resource use indeed price measures suggested inflation trended lower second quarter moreover early signs

edged suggesting possibility increases labor costs current higher levels labor utilization even taking account effects rise minimum wage although increases compensation might moderated greater productivity absorbed time lower profit margins risks seemed tilted toward increases inflation point especially growth economy continued outstrip potential added pressures resources course committee

shortages various goods materials lengthening delays securing deliveries evidence time accordingly aggressive inventory accumulation remained upside risk projected expansion one likely materialize unless final demand exceed current forecasts significant margin discussion outlook inflation members observed increases prices remained remarkably subdued extended period relation measures resource

costs materialize would passed higher prices improvements productivity likely offset part increases much remained open question addition profit margins high extent might narrow absorb increasing labor costs difficult predict regard outlook wages members observed though early reach firm judgment acceleration wage increases year might well augur faster advances line historical experience essentially full employment conditions moreover tendency toward reduced increases costs benefits might tend dissipate though members commented economies provision medical services might well achievable period
