remain economy potential longer time persistence underutilized resources expected foster slight moderation core price inflation committee discussion current prospective economic conditions members commented recent data performance economy disappointing tended confirm widespread anecdotal indications economic growth slowed pace well experienced earlier year even members acknowledged economy displayed remarkable resiliency past year despite subjected severe adverse shocks latter clearly taken toll confidence notably business sector consumer spending held relatively well business investment expenditures continued constrained high degree uncertainty related caution looking beyond near term members anticipated prevailing uncertainties began diminish economy resiliency abetted broadly accommodative monetary fiscal polices continuation strong uptrend productivity would underpin gradual economic recovery indeed members commented even robust recovery could ruled absence major shocks confidence pressures labor resources expected limited coming quarters inflation likely remain subdued perhaps even edge little lower review developments prospects key expenditure sectors economy members noted consumer spending appeared decelerated since midsummer anticipated hopefully compensating strengthening business investment yet materialized factors cited members appeared help account recent softness consumer demand included substantial decreases equity wealth declining consumer confidence context geopolitical uncertainties waning effects earlier income tax cuts failure recent round motor vehicle sales incentives maintain extraordinary level sales seen summer looking ahead members referred subdued expectations among retailer contacts regarding upcoming holiday season sales prospects likely held back least marginally lingering effects recent west coast dock strike availability merchandise also question whether funds extracted rising home equity values would

importantly outlook continued robust growth structural labor productivity favorable effects time wages salaries high persisting uncertainty concomitant aversion risk among business executives

industrial commercial structures divergence opinion expressed regarding overall extent capital overhangs though clearly evident industries high vacancy rates nonresidential buildings many areas

turn investment activity cautious business attitudes expectations sluggish sales coming months inducing business firms continue hold already generally lean inventories nonetheless members commented inventory accumulation likely provide limited impetus economy next several quarters extent acceleration economic activity occurred businesses sought maintain acceptable balance inventories sales indeed inventories unusually low levels many industries efforts rebuild inventories appeared inevitable housing activity remained generally elevated level recent months context low mortgage interest rates likely would continue provide important support economy forecast period regional reports indicated persisting strength housing sector though evidence modestly flagging activity areas regard

home improvements consumer durables generally still household spending probably would continue supported increases income wealth associated strengthening economic expansion rising productivity members commented fiscal policy remained accommodative analysis cited meeting suggested stimulus embodied current legislation diminished considerably since earlier year reference also made partial expensing provision tax legislation enacted march year seen positive compelling factor inducing expenditures business equipment software members observed federal tax cuts enacted would likely take effect late foster much added spending year ahead state local government levels efforts control large deficits likely would lead tax spending legislation would offset least part remaining stimulus inherent federal budget members commented little stimulus could expected export sector economy light current prospective shortfalls economic performance important u trading partners indeed recent forecasts incorporated downward revisions growth overall foreign economic activity economy evidently lower anticipated growth path slack labor product markets elevated levels members anticipated inflation would remain quite subdued year ahead even context anticipated acceleration economic activity indeed prospect persisting slack resource use coming quarters pointed disinflation regard members referred possibility viewed remote period deflation event strongly negative demand shock committee discussion policy intermeeting period ahead members favored proposal reduce target intended federal funds rate 50 basis points 1 1 4 percent current stance monetary policy still accommodative providing important support economic activity members concerned generally disappointing data since previous meeting reinforcing general thrust anecdotal evidence recent months pointed longer lasting spell subpar economic performance anticipated earlier circumstances relatively aggressive easing action could help ensure current soft spot economy would prove temporary enhance odds robust rebound economic activity next year reason cited members sizable easing move related perceptions diminishing stimulus earlier policy easing actions indications overall financial conditions including bank lending terms become restrictive year even though nominal federal funds rate target changed since late 2001 members agreed monetary policy could little improve performance economy near term emphasized 50 basis point easing likely would feed degree market interest rates favorable implications spending next year members commented potential costs policy easing action later proved needed quite limited little risk move would foster inflationary pressures likely economic conditions next several quarters moreover policy easing could readily unwound without significant effects financial markets reversal appeared warranted growing pressures resources strengthening economy contrast failure take action needed faltering economic performance would increase odds cumulatively weakening economy possibly even attendant deflation effort offset development appear materializing would present difficult policy implementation problems members indicated light contemplated 50 basis point easing action could support shift committee assessment risks economy tilted toward economic weakness balanced foreseeable future although voiced reservations need shift economy probably would continue underperform period immediately ahead absence unpredictable adverse shocks sluggish performance likely balanced subsequent economic strength light policy action 50 basis point move would tend pronounced effect usual financial markets least initially would largely unexpected would come extended hiatus implementing policy changes view many members retaining assessment risks tilted toward weakness would raise odds overreaction financial markets might well misread committee decision sign members concerned potential greater economic weakness fact case therefore committee currently saw likely need easing later members saw lesser risk development partly widespread market expectations even sizable reduction intended federal funds rate committee would change assessment unbalanced risks economy present circumstances although least marginal preference retaining current tilt toward weakness members willing accept balanced statement light uncertainties surrounded prospective market reactions possible market response primary factor determining desirability policy action committee needed take account gauging potential
