for immediate release share the FOMC decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 5 1 4 percent recent indicators suggest that economic growth is moderating from its quite strong pace earlier this year partly reflecting a gradual cooling of the housing market and the lagged effects of increases in interest rates and energy prices readings on core inflation have been elevated in recent months ongoing productivity gains have held down the rise in unit labor costs and inflation expectations remain contained however the high levels of resource utilization and of the prices of energy and other commodities have the potential to sustain inflation pressures although the moderation in the growth of aggregate demand should help to limit inflation pressures over time the FOMC judges that some inflation risks remain the extent and timing of any additional firming that may be needed to address these risks will depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth as implied by incoming information in any event the FOMC will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to support the attainment of its objectives
