longer run ongoing capacity repo operations could viewed useful ample reserves regime way providing insurance unexpected stresses money markets could drive federal funds rate outside committee target range sustained period staff presented two potential approaches conducting repo operations committee decided maintain ongoing role operations first approach desk would conduct modestly sized relatively frequent repo operations designed provide high degree readiness need larger operations arise second approach fomc would establish standing fixed rate facility could serve automatic money market stabilizer 8 assessing two approaches involved several considerations including degree assurance control federal funds rate likelihood participation federal reserve repo operations could become stigmatized possibility operations could encourage federal reserve counterparties take excessive liquidity risks portfolios potential disintermediation financial transactions currently undertaken private counterparties regular modestly sized repo operations likely would pose relatively little risk stigma moral hazard may provide less assurance control federal funds rate might difficult federal reserve anticipate money market pressures scale repo operations accordingly standing fixed rate repo facility would likely provide substantial assurance control federal funds rate use facility could become stigmatized particularly rate set relatively high level conversely standing facility rate set relatively low level could result larger frequent repo operations would appropriate effectively standing ready provide form liquidity needed basis facility could increase risk institutions may take undesirably high amount liquidity risk comments following staff presentation participants

described staff conducting repo operations many participants noted ample supply reserves firmly established might little need standing repo facility frequent repo operations participants indicated basic principle implementing ample reserves framework maintain reserves ongoing basis levels would obviate need open market operations address pressures funding markets exceptional circumstances many participants remarked however even environment ample reserves standing facility could serve useful backstop support control federal funds rate event outsized shocks system several participants also suggested standing facility created allowed banks monetize portion securities holdings times market stress banks could possibly reduce demand reserves normal times could make feasible monetary policy implementation framework operate significantly smaller quantity reserves would otherwise needed couple participants pointed establishing standing facility would similar practice major central banks number participants noted deciding whether implement standing repo facility additional work would necessary assess likely implications different design choices standing repo facility pricing eligible counterparties set acceptable collateral echoing issues raised committee june 2019 meeting various participants commented need carefully evaluate design choices guard potential moral hazard stigma disintermediation risk excessive volatility federal reserve balance sheet couple participants suggested approach based modestly sized frequent repo operations could quickly substantially ramped
