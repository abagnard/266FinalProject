for immediate release the FOMC decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 1 1 4 percent the FOMC believes that even after this action the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative and coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity is providing ongoing support to economic activity the evidence accumulated over the intermeeting period indicates that output is continuing to expand at a solid pace and labor market conditions have improved although incoming inflation data are somewhat elevated a portion of the increase in recent months appears to have been due to transitory factors the FOMC perceives the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability for the next few quarters are roughly equal with underlying inflation still expected to be relatively low the FOMC believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured nonetheless the FOMC will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability
