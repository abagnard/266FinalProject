for immediate release the FOMC decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 1 percent the FOMC continues to believe that an accommodative stance of monetary policy coupled with still robust underlying growth in productivity is providing important ongoing support to economic activity the evidence accumulated over the intermeeting period shows that spending is firming although labor market indicators are mixed business pricing power and increases in core consumer prices remain muted the FOMC perceives that the upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth for the next few quarters are roughly equal in contrast the probability though minor of an unwelcome fall in inflation exceeds that of a rise in inflation from its already low level the FOMC judges that on balance the risk of inflation becoming undesirably low is likely to be the predominant concern for the foreseeable future in these circumstances the FOMC believes that policy accommodation can be maintained for a considerable period
