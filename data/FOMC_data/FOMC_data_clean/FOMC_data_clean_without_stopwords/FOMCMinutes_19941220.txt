appreciable slowing year sustainable less inflationary pace remained reasonable expectation likely much restraint policy firming actions implemented year yet experienced actions reversed accommodative policy place early 1994 effects probably still felt latter part 1994 members acknowledged timing extent slowing expansion subject considerable uncertainty however economy operating even slightly noninflationary potential price wage pressures likely build unless anticipated slowing occurred relatively soon key measures inflation including consumer prices wages producer prices finished goods

early new year number members commented inflation probably would worsen somewhat near term subsequent behavior prices wages would depend importantly fiscal monetary policy developments extent inflationary expectations among businesses consumers degree pressure economic expansion would exert capacity various industries occupations given projections moderation business expansion assuming appropriate fiscal monetary policies members generally felt added inflation emerging 1995 would likely mild could subside gradually year committee discussion policy intermeeting period ahead majority

reassessment early next year members expressed preference additional tightening policy meeting view considerable strength economic expansion high level resource utilization argued monetary restraint counter inflationary pressures immediate action also would moderate inflationary expectations reinforcing credibility system anti inflationary effort one members indicated however could accept unchanged directive biased toward possible firming intermeeting period issue possible adjustments policy period next meeting majority members expressed preference asymmetric directive tilted toward restraint members preferred tighten policy point believed need monetary restraint highly likely though would remain contingent tenor new information including data holiday retail sales would begin arrive shortly turn year need restraint become apparent would desirable view appropriate policy move made promptly arrest worsening inflation inflationary expectations thereby minimizing cumulative policy tightening would required ultimate cost bringing inflation control committee always option adjusting policy intermeeting periods even symmetric directive balance risks outlook argued view members policy reaction new information best characterized asymmetric directive members favored unchanged policy preferred symmetric directive view information would released weeks immediately ahead likely depart sufficiently current expectations warrant policy tightening move intermeeting period moreover current forecasts subject risks directions direction appreciably greater projected slowing expansion might relatively low probability least quarters immediately ahead risk could ruled argued cautious approach tightening accordingly committee wait next scheduled meeting information possibly including better assessment outlook fiscal policy would available evaluating need firming monetary policy one member expressed view would desirable make short run policy moves context committee long
