information received since the FOMC met in july suggests that economic activity is expanding at a moderate pace on balance labor market conditions improved somewhat further however the unemployment rate is little changed and a range of labor market indicators suggests that there remains significant underutilization of labor resources household spending appears to be rising moderately and business fixed investment is advancing while the recovery in the housing sector remains slow fiscal policy is restraining economic growth although the extent of restraint is diminishing inflation has been running below the FOMC s longer run objective longer term inflation expectations have remained stable consistent with its statutory mandate the FOMC seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability the FOMC expects that with appropriate policy accommodation economic activity will expand at a moderate pace with labor market indicators and inflation moving toward levels the FOMC judges consistent with its dual mandate the FOMC sees the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced and judges that the likelihood of inflation running persistently below 2 percent has diminished somewhat since early this year the FOMC currently judges that there is sufficient underlying strength in the broader economy to support ongoing improvement in labor market conditions in light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions since the inception of the current asset purchase program the FOMC decided to make a further measured reduction in the pace of its asset purchases beginning in october the FOMC will add to its holdings of agency mortgage backed securities at a pace of 5 billion per month rather than 10 billion per month and will add to its holdings of longer term treasury securities at a pace of 10 billion per month rather than 15 billion per month the FOMC is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities in agency mortgage backed securities and of rolling over maturing treasury securities at auction the FOMC s sizable and still increasing holdings of longer term securities should maintain downward pressure on longer term interest rates support mortgage markets and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation over time is at the rate most consistent with the FOMC s dual mandate the FOMC will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months and will continue its purchases of treasury and agency mortgage backed securities and employ its other policy tools as appropriate until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability if incoming information broadly supports the FOMC s expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer run objective the FOMC will end its current program of asset purchases at its next meeting however asset purchases are not on a preset course and the FOMC s decisions about their pace will remain contingent on the FOMC s outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases to support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability the FOMC today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy remains appropriate in determining how long to maintain the current 0 to 1 4 percent target range for the federal funds rate the FOMC will assess progress both realized and expected toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation this assessment will take into account a wide range of information including measures of labor market conditions indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations and readings on financial developments the FOMC continues to anticipate based on its assessment of these factors that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends especially if projected inflation continues to run below the FOMC s 2 percent longer run goal and provided that longer term inflation expectations remain well anchored when the FOMC decides to begin to remove policy accommodation it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent the FOMC currently anticipates that even after employment and inflation are near mandate consistent levels economic conditions may for some time warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the FOMC views as normal in the longer run
