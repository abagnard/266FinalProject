guidelines for the conduct of system open market operations in federal agency issues the FOMC initially suspended these paragraphs in august 1999 and subsequently extended the suspension annually for the years through 2002 paragraphs 1 and 2 which provide general guidance for the conduct of system open market operations in federal agency obligations were retained in their existing form guidelines for the conduct of system open market operations in federal agency issues amended january 28 2003 system open market operations in federal agency issues are an integral part of total system open market operations designed to influence bank reserves money market conditions and monetary aggregates system open market operations in federal agency issues are not designed to support individual sectors of the market or to channel funds into issues of particular agencies by unanimous vote the FOMC amended its program for security of fomc information on january 28 2003 to update references to

to operate the system account amended january 28 2003 the chairman of the FOMC is authorized to appoint a federal reserve bank as agent to operate the system account temporarily in case the federal reserve bank of new york is unable to function in the event the chairman exercises such authority the chairman also is authorized to appoint a federal reserve official to act temporarily as manager of the system account by unanimous vote the minutes of the meeting of the FOMC held on december 10 2002 were approved the manager of the system open market account reported on recent developments in foreign exchange markets there were no open market operations in foreign currencies for the system s account in the period since the previous meeting the manager also reported on developments in domestic financial markets and on system open market transactions in government securities and securities issued or fully guaranteed by federal agencies during the period december 10 2002 through january 28 2003 by unanimous vote the FOMC ratified these transactions at this meeting the FOMC discussed staff presentations on whether policy adjustments incorporating gradual movements in the federal funds rate were desirable in terms of optimally achieving the FOMC s macroeconomic objectives the staff presentations examined whether policy adjustments historically had been implemented gradually or whether instead the observed tendency for the federal funds rate to move slowly through time reflected the behavior of the underlying variables to which policy was responding members expressed a range of views regarding the evidence and its implications for policy including potential situations that might call for relatively aggressive policy actions the FOMC then turned to a discussion of the economic and financial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting period ahead the information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic growth was very slow in the fourth quarter housing demand and consumer spending firmed toward the end of the year but capital spending remained quite weak in an environment of substantial business uncertainty and pessimism a sharp drop in motor vehicle output held down overall industrial production and the labor market deteriorated further core consumer price inflation continued to decline through the end of the year private nonfarm payroll employment fell again in december and was at its lowest level since september 1999 job losses in manufacturing continued to be sizable and employment in retail trade plunged although part of that decline might have been attributable to lower than usual hiring of temporary sales help for the holiday season by contrast hiring in the services industry picked up and employment in the finance insurance and real estate group continued to expand the unemployment rate held at 6 percent in december a level consistent with other labor market indicators industrial production slowed a little further in december reflecting another sharp drop in motor vehicle assemblies and a decline in electricity generation excluding motor vehicles and parts manufacturing output increased slightly following small declines in october and november production of high tech goods continued to rise in december and output in industries other than high tech and transportation increased for the first time since august despite the uptick in production in some areas of manufacturing capacity utilization in manufacturing fell again in december and was substantially below its long run average retail sales increased appreciably in november and december even though disposable personal income posted relatively modest gains and readings on consumer confidence were generally low purchases of new motor vehicles were brisk and were accompanied by moderate further increases in other categories of retail sales residential housing activity remained strong through the end of the year despite continued sluggish employment and additional declines in household wealth with mortgage rates remaining near historical lows single family housing starts increased further in november and december and the backlog of unused permits along with other information suggested that starts likely would remain strong in coming months new home sales reached yet another record high in december and existing home sales neared their record level established in january 2002 in the multifamily sector starts rebounded in november and december from a sharp drop in october nonetheless multifamily homebuilding was at a relatively low level at year end reflecting falling rents and high vacancy rates business spending on equipment and software appeared to have little or no forward momentum in the fourth quarter and to have been weaker than might have been suggested by the recent pattern of business output corporate cash flow and the user cost of capital both shipments of and orders for nondefense capital goods turned down in the fourth quarter with aircraft and communications equipment registering the steepest declines in shipments in the nonresidential sector construction activity slowed only a little further in october and november following a sharp drop in the third quarter however current weakness in rents and property values suggested continued deterioration in activity the book value of manufacturing and trade inventories excluding motor vehicles dropped sharply in october and changed little in november manufacturers trimmed stocks in both months though durable goods manufacturers increased their inventories sharply in december wholesalers cut their inventories substantially in october and held them steady in november retail inventories changed little over the two month period aggregate inventory sales ratios in all three categories remained at very low levels the u s trade deficit in goods and services widened significantly in november with the value of imports rising more than that of exports combining october and november imports increased from the third quarter average while exports declined somewhat available information on economic activity abroad in the fourth quarter suggested slower growth on average in the major foreign economies economic expansion in japan appeared to have slowed markedly and growth in the euro area remained sluggish by contrast the canadian economy continued to expand briskly while activity in the united kingdom seemed to be growing more moderately in the emerging market economies conditions in south america were generally still fragile the pace of economic recovery in mexico appeared to have slowed and growth had softened in much of emerging asia economic growth in china remained strong core consumer price inflation as measured by the consumer price index cpi and the chain weighted personal consumption expenditure pce index continued to edge lower through the end of the year however the sizable run up in energy prices last year boosted overall consumer price inflation somewhat on a year over year basis at the producer level core prices for finished goods declined in november and december but for the year as a whole the jump in energy prices pushed overall producer prices for finished goods up slightly with regard to labor costs average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers increased moderately in december but the change in those earnings over the year was considerably smaller than in 2001 evidently reflecting the slack in labor markets at its meeting on december 10 2002 the FOMC adopted a directive that called for maintaining conditions in reserve markets consistent with keeping the federal funds rate around 1 1 4 percent and retained an assessment that the risks to its longer term objectives were balanced the FOMC noted that monetary policy was quite accommodative and well positioned to support a strengthening economic expansion in line with the members expectations for coming quarters the FOMC s decision was widely anticipated and elicited little reaction financial markets were sensitive however to shifting perceptions of global risks economic releases that generally were seen as having a disappointing tone pessimistic expectations for fourth quarter corporate profits and the administration s announcement of an economic stimulus package larger than had been anticipated against that backdrop longer term treasury yields declined somewhat while in private debt markets a sense of reduced concern about governance issues and perhaps some increased appetite for risk taking led to a substantial decline in yields across the credit spectrum that further narrowed risk spreads major stock price indexes moved widely during the intermeeting period but most finished the period a little lower the dollar depreciated substantially in terms of an index of major foreign currencies with particularly large declines against the euro the yen and the swiss franc market worries about growing tensions over iraq and north korea appeared to be a key factor but concerns about the downbeat tone of recent u s economic data and the potential vulnerability of the dollar to a general pullback of international capital further damped market sentiment the drop of the dollar occurred despite continued signs of weak growth in the euro area and japan and sizable reductions in the yields of their long term government securities growth of m2 fell considerably in december much of the deceleration was concentrated in the liquid components of the aggregate likely reflecting in part an adjustment in the volume of mortgage refinancings and the associated prepayments on mortgage backed securities the staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the expansion of economic activity would be muted in the very near term faced with intensified geopolitical tensions as well as continuing pessimism about the near term course of economic activity labor market conditions and corporate earnings businesses and consumers were likely to hold down their spending in addition continued sluggish economic growth among most major trading partners would tend to damp u s exports however those restraining influences were expected to abate over time the considerable monetary ease already in place the prospect of significantly more fiscal stimulus the continuing strong gains in structural productivity and the anticipated improvement in business confidence would provide significant impetus to spending inventory overhangs had been largely eliminated and business capital stocks had moved closer to desired levels as a consequence a slowly improving outlook for sales and profits low financing costs and the temporary federal tax incentive for investment in new equipment and software were expected to gradually boost business investment spending the persistence of underutilized resources would tend to foster some moderation in core price inflation in the FOMC s discussion of current and prospective economic developments members emphasized that their forecasts were subject to substantial uncertainties dominated at this point by the geopolitical situation but they continued to view a pickup in economic growth as a reasonable expectation for the year ahead household spending had been well maintained over the course of recent months but a high degree of caution had induced business firms to continue to hold down their spending and hiring it was suggested that the uncertainties relating to geopolitical tensions and possible war in iraq important factors contributing to business caution might be at least partly resolved in the near term helping to roll back some of the recent increase in oil prices and likely having favorable implications for consumer and business spending even so the response of the economy was hard to anticipate because of the difficulty of disentangling the effects of current geopolitical tensions from the underlying momentum of the economy moreover even a short and successful military campaign could give rise to a variety of disruptions that might limit at least for a time an improvement in business and consumer confidence the members nonetheless saw a number of favorable factors that could be expected to foster a relatively robust economic expansion over time these included a stimulative monetary policy along with generally accommodative financial conditions the prospect of additional fiscal stimulus an increasing need for expenditures by business firms to replace depreciated equipment and to maintain acceptable inventory levels and continued vigorous growth in productivity that would support profits and incomes with regard to the outlook for inflation prospective growth of spending in line with the members forecasts likely would continue to be associated with only muted pressures on labor and other resources over the year ahead and given current trends in productivity members anticipated that consumer price inflation would remain subdued indeed modest further disinflation might occur over the year ahead in preparing for the semiannual monetary policy report to congress the board members and reserve bank presidents provided individual projections of the growth of gdp civilian unemployment and consumer price inflation for the year 2003 the members agreed that because of the unusual uncertainties that clouded their current forecasts the latter should be viewed as having extremely wide confidence bands their forecasts envisaged a strengthening economic recovery but not one that was likely to induce a material if any decline in the unemployment rate over the year ahead their forecasts of growth in real gdp for 2003 had a central tendency of 3 1 4 to 3 1 2 percent and a full range of 3 to 3 3 4 percent measured as the change between the fourth quarter of 2002 and the fourth quarter of 2003 their projections of the civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year were all in a range of 5 3 4 to 6 percent their forecasts of consumer price inflation for the year as measured by the pce chain type price index were centered in a range of 1 1 4 to 1 1 2 percent with a full range of 1 1 4 to 1 3 4 percent in the FOMC s discussion of developments in key sectors of the economy members continued to place emphasis on the critical role of business spending and hiring decisions in determining the strength of the expansion an elevated level of business caution clearly was holding back investment spending and there were few signs of a pickup in the near term given an eventual reduction in prevailing uncertainties however a number of members noted that the outlook for business spending was favorable and they did not rule out a sharp snapback in business expenditures as the year progressed factors cited in support of this view included the wide availability and low cost of capital the increasing need for replacing worn and outdated capital equipment with the passage of time a decline in overall stocks of capital in relation to the economy s growing potential and the anticipated continuation of what appeared to be an upward trend in sales cash flows and profits some members also referred to the positive effects on some business decisions of the temporary federal tax incentives for expenditures on business equipment and software the members agreed that the strength and timing of the prospective improvement remained subject to a high degree of uncertainty indeed a number of members commented that it was possible that some easing of geopolitical tensions would not lead to a major near term upturn in business confidence and business expenditures such an outcome would be especially likely if oil supplies were disrupted a threat that could not be ruled out with adverse consequences for oil prices and business costs moreover the current excess capacity would permit many firms to meet likely demands for some period of time without a significant increase in capital investments the evident uncertainty and pessimism in the business community were also reflected in tight inventory control policies despite continuing gains in final sales inventories were estimated to have changed little in the fourth quarter and currently were at levels that were widely viewed as unusually low in relation to sales in these circumstances an easing at some point of current uncertainties and strengthening confidence should induce inventory rebuilding with positive implications at least for a time for the expansion of economic activity the household sector had continued to provide vital support to overall demand in recent months despite a deteriorating trend in consumer confidence while numerous contacts reported generally disappointing holiday sales in an environment of atypically large and widespread discounting a surge in motor vehicle sales in december fostered by aggressive sales incentives and some pickup in retail sales late in the holiday season helped to sustain moderate overall growth in consumer spending through the year end looking ahead a number of factors seemed likely to undergird consumer spending including the positive effects on permanent incomes of robust ongoing growth in productivity the possibly accelerated phase in of tax reductions stemming from earlier legislation the prospects for additional reductions in federal taxes affecting household incomes and more generally the continued favorable effects of low interest rates and widely available financing on consumer purchases of motor vehicles and other durables at the same time some members expressed concern about the potential for adverse effects on consumer incomes and confidence should stagnant conditions persist in labor markets and equity markets weaken further reference also was made to the possibility suggested by some analysts that the value of housing wealth might be leveling off in that event mortgage refinancings might moderate once mortgage rates stabilized reducing the impetus to consumer spending from this source statistical indicators of housing activity and anecdotal reports from numerous parts of the country pointed to persisting strength in homebuilding with no signs of a slowdown in most areas members generally anticipated that activity in this sector of the economy would be well maintained in the context of low mortgage rates and further growth in incomes but a few expressed reservations about forecasts of a further pickup this year the members anticipated the enactment of new legislation that would add to the fiscal stimulus that was already incorporated in earlier legislation while greater fiscal stimulus appeared to be desirable to counter near term weakness in the economy the new legislation probably could not be enacted in time to begin to exert an expansionary impact on the economy before the latter part of this year when the anticipated strengthening of the economy might already be well under way members also observed that given the competing legislative proposals currently under consideration the eventual components and size of that legislation were very uncertain at this point though they were likely to be importantly influenced by the performance of the economy and especially labor market conditions over coming months a number of members expressed the hope that the legislation would not encompass provisions that would lead to permanently large federal deficits with negative consequences for the economy over the longer term as they had at previous meetings members also commented on the severe fiscal problems being experienced by numerous state and local governments it was noted that state revenue shortfalls were being aggravated by federally mandated costs related to homeland security that were not at least currently being reimbursed by the federal government another problem related to certain tax proposals under consideration in the congress notably the exclusion of dividends from income that could have adverse consequences for the revenues of numerous state and local governments that linked their taxable incomes to those reported on federal returns more generally while state and local efforts to redress budget imbalances were likely to offset only a small part of the probable stimulus in forthcoming federal legislation some members commented that those efforts might well involve more fiscal restraint than was currently foreseen by some analysts largely reflecting their expectations of ongoing albeit diminishing slack in labor and product markets the members anticipated that consumer price inflation probably would edge down over the next several quarters from an already low level members also referred to a number of crosscurrents bearing on the outlook for prices that included the adverse effects of recent declines in the dollar and higher oil prices but also the opposing effects of a strong uptrend in productivity and highly competitive markets in holding down prices and costs with regard to labor costs members cited anecdotal evidence of persisting weakness in numerous regional labor markets and given the current reluctance of employers to add to their workforces the prospect that job gains and labor compensation would tend to lag the anticipated strengthening in economic activity as they often had in the past in the FOMC s discussion of policy for the intermeeting period all the members supported a proposal to maintain an unchanged policy stance while the economy had continued to grow slowly monetary policy and overall financial conditions had remained accommodative and the prospects for an appreciable strengthening of the economic expansion over time were favorable as some of the prevailing uncertainties currently impairing spending began to lift possibly in the near term with regard to military developments in the middle east the FOMC should be in a much better position to assess the underlying strength of the economy and the appropriate policy response at this point the FOMC could not rule out a range of plausible economic outcomes including the possibility of a persisting subpar economic performance or a much stronger
