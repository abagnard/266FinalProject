precautionary demand inventories occurred 1994 regard outlook inflation members observed increases prices remained subdued despite rapid expansion economic activity recent quarters associated increase

adjustments cpi partial explanations however members found difficult account surprisingly benign behavior inflation economy operating level approximating full employment indeed possibly somewhat sustainable full employment labor markets view number members especially taking consideration recent decline unemployment rate basis historical patterns overshooting full employment would expected generate rising inflation time although increases labor compensation trending higher pressures muted shown prices members focused possible role faster reported increases productivity key explanation benign behavior inflation current circumstances business firms continued report robust profit margins period competitive pressures generally prevented raising prices raising sufficiently pass increases experiencing worker compensation standard statistical measures pointed relatively limited increases productivity seemed inconsistent strong profits well anecdotal reports sizable gains

increasing skills infrastructure needed use effectively appeared creating growing efficiencies synergies markedly enhancing productivity enabling firms hold line prices maintain high profit margins welcome developments members continued express concern perhaps sooner rather later growing pressures productive resources would reflected upturn overall inflation although measures labor compensation relatively favorable recently measures displaying clear uptrend somewhat longer period seemed likely trend continued labor cost developments would point reflected fully core measures prices members commented timing extent upturn price inflation would depend growth overall demand economy also believed expansion demand line current expectations could induce somewhat less favorable inflation experience coming quarters however recent developments underscored fact historical experience fully reliable guide prospective behavior prices accordingly inflation outlook remained subject considerable uncertainty committee discussion policy intermeeting period ahead one members indicated could support proposal maintain unchanged policy stance although also expressed preference tightening meeting endorsed steady policy time agreed tightening might well needed later contain potentially rising inflation however economic growth seemed slowing sustainable pace uncertainties surrounding extent slowing outlook inflation pointed desirability cautious approach policy tightening especially given persisting absence rising inflation trend current measures prices number members also observed real interest rates unusually low thus present stance monetary policy probably far alignment likely would prove desirable degree restraint thereby lessening risk large persisting imbalances delay implementing restraint might incur members preferred tightening least near term necessarily meeting noted committee needed weigh risks implement small degree restraint versus considerably later inflation allowed build momentum monetary policy exerts effects considerable lag small relatively prompt tightening action would provide insurance intensification inflation outcome could seen likely given increased tightness labor markets possibility relatively strong growth would put added pressures resources members commented risk retarding effect economy small move time quite limited light apparently solid momentum economic expansion indeed strength investment demand ready availability financing possible favorable productivity gains argued real rates interest would need higher historical norms balance aggregate demand supply risk slightly lower economic growth needed compared viewed greater risk losing ground inflation thereby inhibiting committee ability reach ultimate goal price stability goal members viewed necessary achieve maximum sustainable economic growth time given quiescence inflation uncertainties surrounding outlook however one members could accept wait see policy stance regard possible adjustments policy intermeeting period members supported shift symmetric directive adopted conjunction policy tightening action march meeting asymmetric directive tilted toward tightening bias necessarily imply intention tighten policy weeks immediately ahead consistent members view risks direction potential need tightening monetary policy counter rising inflationary pressures might required make decision distant future conclusion committee discussion one member indicated supported directive called maintaining existing degree pressure reserve
