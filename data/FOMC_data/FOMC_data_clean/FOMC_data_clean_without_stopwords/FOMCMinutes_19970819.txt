expansion economy would damped second half year slowing inventory accumulation unsustainably brisk pace first half year 1998 economy would expand pace line growth estimated potential growth consumer spending supported high levels household wealth projected gains employment income expected relatively brisk forecast horizon business spending equipment structures anticipated continue outpace overall expansion economy though differential would tend narrow time association gradual diminution increases sales profits expected conjunction moderating economic growth housing construction projected drift lower forecast horizon staff anticipated external sector would exert mild restraint expansion economic activity labor compensation gradually accelerating context higher resource utilization core consumer price inflation forecast drift slightly higher committee discussion current prospective economic developments highlighted statistical anecdotal evidence solid economic performance including indications rebound final demand lull spring persistence relatively subdued measures declining inflation growth consumer spending slowed sharply surge inventory accumulation accounted much expansion economic activity second quarter looking ahead members believe recent developments altered prospect economy would settle pattern moderate growth approximating potential forecast subject considerable uncertainty several members observed risks appeared mostly direction stronger growth demand regard outlook inflation widespread evidence tight labor markets associated scattered indications rise labor compensation might accelerating overall labor costs remained relatively damped price inflation restrained gains productivity muted increases nonlabor costs probably also contributing holding producer costs good control nonetheless members remained concerned risks rising inflation especially somewhat faster projected growth economic activity occur add pressures resources economy already seemed operating close perhaps even sustainable potential uncertain prospects inventory investment dominant factor outlook economic activity nearer term accumulation inventories unusually high second quarter according available evidence broad sense undesired buildup rate inventory investment would reined overhang averted concern regard apparent upturn final demand particularly proved somewhat stronger currently expected related business optimism sales prospects might well result buildup inventories relatively rapid rate development viewed likely outcome indeed less projected strength inventory sector could ruled relatively rapid inventory accumulation context persisting trend growth final demand would generate additional pressure resources heighten risks accelerating inflation regard prospects final demand key sectors economy members noted appreciable rebound consumer spending followed weak second quarter moderation growth spending likely later year 1998 even favorable prospects employment incomes large gains occurred financial wealth suggested consumer expenditures likely well maintained projection horizon high level consumer confidence reported consumer surveys another supporting factor favorable outlook area business fixed investment strong upward trend outlays new equipment thought likely persist notably computer related telecommunications industries anecdotal reports also pointed appreciable strength commercial construction activity including office structures hotels warehouses various parts country indeed areas construction activity said limited shortages qualified labor positive factors outlook business investment included persistence high level profits accommodative financial climate rapid obsolescence high tech equipment nonetheless indications moderation commercial construction activity number areas including reports developing overcapacity retail space shopping centers spending basic industrial equipment also likely soften given moderating growth overall final demand line current forecasts housing activity continued display considerable vigor many parts nation evidenced available statistics anecdotal reports affordability housing large increases occurred stock market wealth clearly supportive factors concurrently however indications slowing residential building activity several areas balance moderation housing construction appeared likely projection horizon keeping longer term population trends affecting construction committee discussion prospects inflation members commented number factors could cited explain persistence relatively subdued inflation year despite high levels resource use among factors appreciation dollar effects prices imports competing domestic products significant decline world oil prices relatively sluggish performance many foreign economies tended moderate prices products traded world markets relatively large grain harvests united states curbed pressures food prices however underlying reasons favorable price trends entirely clear labor costs still rising appreciably less would expected basis past experience similarly tight labor market conditions explanations tended focus concerns job security felt many workers muted rise costs worker benefits notably health care increased use innovative highly targeted methods compensation regard market pricing goods businesses tended cite highly competitive conditions across nation made difficult raise prices gave impetus efforts improve productivity indeed available evidence suggested profits business concerns generally continued increase second quarter implying productivity rising pace exceeded published estimates significant margin even though inflation accelerated signs beginning emerge wages labor costs might experiencing increasing pressure included limited evidence job security concerns might diminishing multiplying anecdotal reports less benign outlook health care costs members commented outcome recent labor negotiations involving large package delivery firm might well harbinger militant labor negotiating attitudes background members expressed concern increase labor utilization rates could put substantial upward pressures wages eventually would work way prices committee discussion policy intermeeting period ahead members endorsed proposal maintain unchanged policy stance underlying economic conditions

policy appeared appropriately positioned foster committee objectives resisting intensification inflationary pressures supporting fully employed economy level real short term interest rates relatively high historical standards provided assurance current stance policy would accommodate significant increase underlying inflationary pressures nonetheless members remained concerned outlook inflation although decline inflation could ruled persistence current degree tightness labor markets consistent economy growing pace near potential could point begin put pressure costs prices growth somewhat potential members saw distinct possibility would even likely produce result current indications inflation might accelerating policy move called time members saw need continuing vigilance earlier meetings number expressed view anticipatory policy move counter intensifying inflationary pressures likely would needed point committee discussion possible adjustments policy intermeeting period
