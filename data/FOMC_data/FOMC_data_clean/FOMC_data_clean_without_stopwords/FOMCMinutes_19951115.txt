potential future course inflation several commented current monetary policy might viewed somewhat restrictive though degree restraint difficult calibrate appear yet inhibiting declines intermediate long term interest rates increases stock prices availability financing lending institutions members expressed somewhat differing views regarding stance monetary policy likely prove consistent committee objectives time view private spending likely sufficient momentum overcome effects increased fiscal restraint current stance monetary policy maintained circumstances easing point would needed foster sustained economic growth acceptable pace would consistent progress toward system price stability objective members however stronger expected performance economy third quarter reduced urgency policy move created enough uncertainties justify careful appraisal unfolding developments decision made ease policy view one member probability shortfall acceptable rate economic expansion sufficiently high require immediate easing policy members believed unchanged policy desirable current conditions direction timing next policy move open question recent data giving uncertain picture underlying strength aggregate demand current forecasts generally point progress toward system long run goal price stability view therefore current stance monetary policy even slightly restrictive likely consistent satisfactory economic growth time would provide better assurance consolidating gains inflation fostering moderation price increases coming years regard potential fiscal policy developments although especially broad range outcomes seemed possible members agreed committee could freeze policy options awaited outcome prolonged federal budget debate could commit specific response particular fiscal policy agreement fiscal policy associated market reactions would among many factors would taken account formulation monetary policy committee discussion possible intermeeting adjustments monetary policy majority members expressed preference retaining symmetric directive view potential need adjust policy relatively short intermeeting period remote members also believed direction next adjustment policy uncertain also noted adoption biased intermeeting instruction point might send unintended message regarding prevailing view within committee concerning risks expansion remaining members said preferred directive tilted toward easing policy action instruction directive would consistent viewed likely policy course coming months agreed however current uncertainties surrounding economic outlook likely resolved weeks immediately ahead since policy action likely required period could accept symmetric directive conclusion committee discussion one
