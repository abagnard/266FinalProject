conditions still favorable cash flow affordability homeownership business spending equipment structures expected grow less rapidly light projected moderate growth sales profits lower rate utilization production capacity prevailing external sector projected exert small restraining influence economic activity projection period even though anticipated firming economic activity abroad would bolster demand u exports little additional fiscal contraction anticipated projection period inflation recently lifted adverse developments energy market projected remain levels recent years given high level resource utilization effects tight grain supplies food prices risks inflationary pressure associated possible elevation federal minimum wage discussion current prospective economic conditions members commented economy stronger year anticipated appeared growing quite robust pace however generally expected expansion slow keeping economy close potential views differed extent regard risks surrounding outlook saw risks fairly evenly balanced given prospective restraint rise bond yields foreign exchange value dollar since early year others expressed concern economic growth might continue pace could increase pressures resources adverse implications inflation economy already operating neighborhood estimated long term potential moreover faster increases energy food prices could contribute higher overall inflation directly boosting inflationary expectations proposed increase minimum wage would add cost pressures enacted law nonetheless chances pickup inflation later risen extent number members emphasized firm evidence surfaced thus far signal labor compensation increasing faster rate core inflation worsening even early signs increased pressures costs prices mixed last years witnessed significantly lower cost pressures subdued inflation typically would experienced earlier years similar rates resource utilization whether favorable outcome would persist open question members observed stronger expected performance economy thus far year reflected relatively rapid growth final demand favorable financial conditions notably relatively low interest rates latter part 1995 early 1996 increases wealth stemming sizable advances stock market prices evidently undergirding expansion indications improving continuing high levels economic activity widespread across nation according recent anecdotal reports regional data though agricultural conditions many areas cited significant exception economy appeared solid balanced momentum pointed sustained growth number factors seen likely foster moderate expansion beginning second half year included effects higher intermediate long term interest rates interest sensitive sectors economy housing consumer durables business fixed investment appreciation dollar past year near term moderation federal government spending also expected exert restraint economic activity forecast horizon members also questioned sustainability performance stock market correction market would help restrain aggregate demand nonetheless continued strength economic activity raised questions whether developments would damp demand sufficiently keep resource utilization sustainable levels review recent developments outlook key sectors economy members noted consumer spending strengthened considerably year period sluggish growth late 1995 recent data consumer spending reinforced anecdotal reports various parts country wealth effects gains occurred stock market prices along sustained increases employment ready availability consumer financing seen playing positive role boosting consumer expenditures barring changes underlying factors continued growth consumer spending seemed likely although members referred developments could begin slow growth months ahead latter included satisfaction much earlier pent demand consumer durables fairly elevated levels consumer debt balance moderate expansion consumer expenditures perhaps line growth incomes seemed likely projection period business fixed investment believed likely remain source considerable strength expansion though growth sector economy also expected moderate elevated pace thus far year desire many business firms users capital equipment take advantage new effective less expensive computer technologies generally add capital effort reduce costs highly competitive markets would continue underpin investment spending addition equity financing remained available relatively attractive terms hand rise business investment recent years brought capital stocks acceptable alignment expected sales damping need sizable additions business firms appeared completed nearly completed efforts bring inventories better balance sales including rebuilding motor vehicle stocks strike major manufacturer settled march basis recent experience subdued growth inventories could anticipated context projected expansion overall economic activity pace near economy long run potential suggested however expectation implied relatively restrained inventory investment comparison past cyclical patterns accordingly much stronger growth investment could occur concomitant effects

perceptible effects housing sales construction indeed housing sector continuing display good deal strength many parts country members observed appreciable momentum housing activity reflected strength underlying fundamentals including continued affordability seemed likely sustain high level housing construction considerable period time despite somewhat higher mortgage rates area fiscal policy

economic conditions abroad would provide impetus real net exports time however imports expected rise appreciably response expansion domestic economic activity appreciation dollar balance external sector probably would boosting real gdp outlook inflation key importance formulation monetary policy time clouded substantial uncertainty one source uncertainty behavior food energy prices increases prices largely accounted rapid rise consumer prices thus far year likely would continue add inflation months ahead retail energy prices risen appreciably least increase expected reversed near term retail food prices yet display significant effects sizable rise grain prices recent months effects retail prices likely extent duration difficult gauge point moreover difficult anticipate much higher food energy prices might affect inflation expectations wage demands thereby potentially become embedded generally price structure also concern members possible effects inflation continued pressures resources especially current pace expansion fail moderate much projected recent years relationship resource use inflation followed earlier patterns particular increases labor compensation comparatively subdued extended period seemed relatively full employment highlighted anecdotal reports scarcities various types labor numerous parts country part worker willingness accept compara tively limited increases compensation could attributed apparent rise insecurity permanence jobs availability alternative jobs reasons fully understood standpoint inflation outlook therefore uncertain long period relatively restrained increases labor compensation would last background number members indicated perceived appreciable risk rising labor costs related inflation even though little evidence date developments others noted could rule possibility favorable experience would extended committee discussion policy intermeeting period ahead members supported proposal maintain unchanged degree pressure reserve markets members agreed balance risks inflation shifted substantially since early year time economy seemed sluggish inflation seen possibly easing recent developments indicated economy stronger rising inflation road could ruled nonetheless policy might need firmed point head emerging inflation pressures financial conditions obviously stimulative counsel need immediate tightening policy real federal funds rate probably greatly line appropriate level rise longer term interest rates exchange rate meant financial conditions exerting restraint earlier year information might provide better sense higher interest rates affecting aggregate demand perhaps also help small degree shed light considerable uncertainties surrounding relationship output inflation event actual inflation data apart food energy prices many usual early warning signs mounting price pressures yet indicate pickup underlying trend prices accordingly members viewed policy appropriately positioned current circumstances though ongoing developments would need reassessed upcoming meeting early july members noted committee would need anticipate act preclude rise core rate inflation materialize would difficult costly reverse regard view expressed firming policy sooner rather later likely end promoting stability output prices committee discussion possible intermeeting adjustments policy members indicated least preference retaining symmetric directive members commented probability developments period would warrant change policy next meeting quite low moreover symmetry rule intermeeting adjustment chairman could call committee consultation incoming information raise questions stance monetary policy members felt especially appropriate policy action represented reversal previous move made full discussion regular meeting members also commented asymmetric directive toward restraint would imply predisposition part committee tighten policy point possibly next meeting would prepared take step evidence warranted preference come july meeting without presumption conclusion committee discussion members indicated preference directive called maintaining existing degree
