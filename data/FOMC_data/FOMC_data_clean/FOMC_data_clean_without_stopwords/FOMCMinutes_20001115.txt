offset growth productivity committee discussion current prospective economic conditions members commented information become available since previous meeting reinforced earlier indications appreciable slowing expansion economic activity cumulating evidence moderating expansion seemed especially clear information employment growth manufacturing output aggregate demand currently appeared growing pace little rate increase economy output potential configuration could well persist coming quarters actual expected shortfalls business profitability led tighter credit conditions many borrowers lower equity prices would continue restrain spending moreover pressure profit margins adverse effects financial markets business investment consumer spending distinct possibility members observed however economic growth rebounded sharply temporary slowdowns previously current expansion several noted possibility less restrictive fiscal policy stance would bolstering demand years ahead although softening aggregate demand moved direction containing potential inflation pressures members continued concerned possibility inflation would edge higher even demand growth slower labor markets likely remain unusually tight time circumstances labor costs could begin rise increasingly excess even elevated gains productivity members also commented energy prices might trend lower soon extent expected market analysts raised prospect dollar might depreciate currently elevated level add potential upward pressures domestic prices forecast horizon key factor underlying economic outlook emergence recent

fostered cautious attitudes part lending institutions investors anecdotal comments around country supported indications surveys tightening terms standards banks business borrowers time spreads

downward pressure nation current account deficits continued cumulate lower dollar would tend favorable effect trade deficit also would add inflationary pressures domestic economy members continued concerned outlook inflation measured increases headline consumer prices could explained mostly result sharp advances energy prices many observers expected reversed point however core consumer price measures also displayed gradual uptrend perhaps part consequence passthrough effects persistently high energy prices measures labor compensation appeared accelerating partly result sharply rising health benefit costs sure unit labor costs nonfinancial corporate sector changed little past year undoubtedly reflecting impressive gains productivity even higher interest rates increased energy input costs adding overall production expenses date competitive pressures continuing inhibit ability many firms pass costs although significant exception number successful efforts impose energy surcharges looking future however members generally agreed risks direction heightening inflation pressures despite belief growth overall demand seemed declined sustainable pace probably would continue expand

members supported proposal maintain unchanged policy stance consistent federal funds rate continuing average 6 1 2 percent despite clear indications moderate expansion economic activity persisting risks heightened inflation pressures remained policy concern particularly context evident gradual uptrend key measures core inflation indeed members commented measures core inflation already near slightly levels viewed acceptable longer run although overall financial conditions tightened course recent months currently appeared holding growth spending added restraint likely necessary contain inflation pressures circumstances members saw maintenance steady policy best course juncture promote committee longer run objectives price stability sustainable economic expansion still growth slowed quickly many members anticipated financial market developments seemed likely keep pressures resources mounting coming quarters circumstances members focused meeting potential desirability moving statement risks weighted toward rising inflation one indicated balanced view risks committee goals price stability sustainable economic growth members agreed stronger case could made shift balanced risk statement previous meeting indicated decision close call several commented developments might moving direction would make shift advisable relatively near future even unanimous concluding change would premature time concerns possibility rising inflation persisted members could see increased risk marked slowing growth relative rapid rate expansion economy potential degree growth demand might remain sufficiently damped contain offset inflation pressures quite uncertain moreover shift committee published views might induce undesirable softening overall financial market conditions would tend add inflation pressures members concluded retaining risk statement weighted toward inflation pressures would best represent current thinking believed desirable provide recognition emergence increased
