might set m3 m2 however members believe persuasive argument could made juncture raising m3 range though want rule option later possibly ranges reviewed midyear indeed make change point might convey misleading message regarding committee policy intentions confidence prospective monetary growth relationships committee also considered potential advantages disadvantages setting specific targets bringing inflation achieving price stability time targets might provide alternative supplemental approach monetary growth ranges found unreliable guides monetary policy past several years members discussed number aspects inflation targeting one hand targeting would help anchor conduct monetary policy progress meeting objectives could enhance credibility federal reserve perhaps reduce overall cost attaining price stability hand close adherence preset inflation targets could unduly constrain federal reserve efforts counteract effects cyclical shortfalls performance economy members agreed
