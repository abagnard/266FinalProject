months 1994 currently appeared unsustainable pace members viewed extent moderation key uncertainty outlook number members observed sharp slowing expansion early next year similar slowdown surge activity closing months 1992 could ruled however saw gains economy solidly based earlier expansion generally expected economy settle pattern moderate growth coming quarters trend rate close somewhat economy long run potential regard outlook inflation members saw little evidence available measures prices wages indicators significant change might already occurred underlying inflation trends nonetheless views varied somewhat regard outlook ranged expectations modest decline core rate inflation concerns possibility acceleration context diminishing margins unemployed production resources

local areas economic activity remained depressed parts country southern california overall strength economy fueled important extent interest sensitive spending producer consumer durables housing tended confirm durability expansion gains spending likely sustained recent rates cash flow income expenditures generated likely foster economic growth especially context generally supportive conditions financial credit markets members acknowledged number factors continued constrain expansion including ongoing though less pervasive balance sheet rebuilding business restructuring downsizing activities downtrend defense spending balance however current developments point marked deviation moderate growth trend economic activity experienced past two years though view number members odds somewhat stronger growth greater earlier expansion regard outlook key sectors economy consumer expenditures seen likely continue provide vital support expansion even though increases consumer spending likely maintained recent rates members noted improved consumer confidence increased spending reflected somewhat greater willingness incur debt least context reduced interest rates members cautioned however growth consumer expenditures exceeded gains incomes extended period insofar could judged available data already low saving rate seemed likely limit potential growth spending moreover negative impact increased tax rates high incomes seemed likely felt especially first half 1994 though extent impact consumer spending remained uncertain positive side members cited number developments would tend bolster overall consumer expenditures including lower energy costs reduced income taxes many individuals stemming indexing lower interest charges various kinds debt generally rise consumer confidence seemed related perceptions improving employment opportunities despite continuing announcements sizable workforce reductions large firms members expected growth real business investment

1994 directly indirectly terms favorable effects purchases home furnishings members commented increases housing starts experienced closing months year might sustainable even housing construction especially single family sector relatively well maintained given likelihood home ownership would remain comparatively affordable context growing incomes favorable mortgage rates limited pressures prices new homes respect fiscal policy members referred prospects cutbacks defense spending probably would continue offset part growth federal government purchases goods services however net reductions government purchases expected diminish projection horizon likewise adverse effects spending rise tax rates higher incomes would tend concentrated first half 1994 impact spending months ahead might well relatively limited many taxpayers probably anticipated higher taxes taken measures mitigate spread effects would meet new tax obligations partly savings proposed health care reform

domestic economy members commented indications change inflationary trends broad measures prices wages despite surge economic activity recent months associated increases capacity utilization rates one important sign growing inflationary pressures rising lead times deliveries materials emerged members noted capacity usage rates approaching reached levels past tended signal onset rising inflation growth competition stemming internationalization numerous markets suggested old capacity benchmarks might longer apply especially context excess capacity many foreign economies potential inflationary effects strong domestic demand pressures might remain subdued period time keeping assessments members reported absence inflationary cost pressures local areas across country persisting comments business contacts regarding inability raise prices achieve satisfactory customary profit margins business executives continued look improvements productivity maintain increase margins numerous reports considerable success implementing productivity gains price developments commodity markets presented mixed picture higher food prices stemming weather conditions earlier year adverse effect broad measures prices drop energy prices favorable implications near term inflation outlook also noted rising inflationary pressures often accompanied pickup credit demands evidence surge demands however

number members expressed concern potential increasing inflationary pressures economy saw need monitor possible future sources inflation special care period ahead especially light considerable lags monetary policy actions effects prices committee discussion monetary policy period next scheduled meeting early february majority members endorsed proposal maintain unchanged conditions reserve markets retain currently unbiased instruction directive concerning possible intermeeting adjustments policy looking forward many members commented committee probably would firm reserve conditions point adjust monetary policy currently quite accommodative stance neutral position policy move might made sooner rather later contain inflation continue provide sound basis sustained economic expansion monetary conditions eased current degree accommodation 1990 1992 period context balance sheet restructuring unusual forces holding spending since latter part 1992 however downside risks expansion diminished considerably financial conditions became supportive economic activity borrowers lenders strengthened financial positions substantially less reluctant use extend credit moreover low level real short term interest rates view members continued rapid growth reserves increases variety commodity prices provided evidence quite accommodative monetary policy overstaying policy would incur increasing risk fostering greater inflationary pressures turn would undermine sustainablity expansion however majority believed risks remained acceptable level given remaining slack economy lack near term inflation pressures waiting developments making policy move warranted light uncertainties surrounding outlook notably regard extent moderation economic growth expected early next year economy settled pattern growth line potential chances greater inflation pressures road would reduced need near term policy adjustment would less pressing though would still required point two members expressed strong preference prompt move toward firmer policy stance forestall inflation pressures number others commented decision close call including two marginal preference tightening policy time could accept delay light uncertainties involved members could support unchanged policy stance also indicated acceptance directive biased either direction regard possible adjustments degree reserve pressure intermeeting period observed flow economic reports period likely underscore marked strengthening economy reports mainly would cover developments fourth quarter monetary policy perspective

prospect argued taking action meeting benefit full committee review implications future growth inflation pressures wide variety emerging developments including money credit financial markets rather intermeeting action based asymmetric directive view one member tightening action coming intermeeting period would incur undue risk exaggerated response financial markets given likelihood thin trading markets around year end since policy move postponed symmetrical directive seemed appropriate conclusion committee discussion two members indicated could support directive called maintaining existing
