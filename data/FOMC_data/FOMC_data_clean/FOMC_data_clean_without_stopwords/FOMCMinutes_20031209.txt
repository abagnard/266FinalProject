seeing small decline inflation distinct possibility even growth proved fairly robust downward pressure prices could come narrowing profit margins currently quite high surprising strength productivity would reduce labor costs addition members noted current unemployment rate likely understated slack labor markets since labor market participation rate fallen significantly late changes payment hiring practices perhaps reduced level unemployment could sustained without upward pressure wages however growth seen assured downward risks inflation viewed considerably reduced relative earlier year risk pernicious deflation declining prices reinforced weakness demand risk members always viewed small regarded virtually nil indeed weaker dollar higher commodity prices outsized increases benefit costs
