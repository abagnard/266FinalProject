remained high rose somewhat members optimistic core inflation might contained near current levels recent increase core inflation could largely reflect indirect effects rise energy prices date unit labor costs quite subdued leaving open question sustainable level labor resource use rising productivity likely continue restrain unit labor costs degree product markets remained highly competitive however even members saw considerable inflation risks slowdown aggregate demand fail sustained members generally agreed foreseeable future possible increases underlying inflation remained principal

policy stance consistent federal funds rate averaging 6 1 2 percent increasing though still tentative indications slowing aggregate demand together likelihood earlier policy tightening actions yet exerted full retarding effects spending key factors decision uncertainties surrounding outlook economy notably extent duration recent moderation spending effects appreciable tightening past year including ½ percentage point increase intended federal funds rate may meeting reinforced argument leaving stance policy unchanged meeting weighting incoming data carefully several members commented considerable amount new information bearing prospective strength economy outlook inflation would become available relatively long interval next meeting august members generally saw little risk deferring policy tightening move particularly since possibility underlying inflation would worsen appreciably seemed remote prevailing circumstances among factors inflation expectations remarkably stable despite rising energy prices real interest rates already relatively elevated discussion balance risks sentence press statement issued shortly meeting members agreed latter continue express every meeting earlier year belief risks remained weighted toward rising inflation indications growth aggregate demand moderating pace closer potential supply still partial tentative labor markets remained unusually tight many committee members noted based currently available information additional firming policy could well needed point future though number also expressed opinion less
