information received since the FOMC met in november indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a solid rate averaging through hurricane related fluctuations job gains have been solid and the unemployment rate declined further household spending has been expanding at a moderate rate and growth in business fixed investment has picked up in recent quarters on a 12 month basis both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy have declined this year and are running below 2 percent market based measures of inflation compensation remain low survey based measures of longer term inflation expectations are little changed on balance consistent with its statutory mandate the FOMC seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability hurricane related disruptions and rebuilding have affected economic activity employment and inflation in recent months but have not materially altered the outlook for the national economy consequently the FOMC continues to expect that with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions will remain strong inflation on a 12 month basis is expected to remain somewhat below 2 percent in the near term but to stabilize around the FOMC s 2 percent objective over the medium term near term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced but the FOMC is monitoring inflation developments closely in view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation the FOMC decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1 1 4 to 1 1 2 percent the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative thereby supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate the FOMC will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation this assessment will take into account a wide range of information including measures of labor market conditions indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations and readings on financial and international developments the FOMC will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal the FOMC expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant gradual increases in the federal funds rate the federal funds rate is likely to remain for some time below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run however the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data
