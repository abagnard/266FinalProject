information received since the federal open market committee met in may indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a solid rate. job gains have been strong on average in recent months and the unemployment rate has declined. recent data suggest that growth of household spending has picked up while business fixed investment has continued to grow strongly. on a 12 month basis both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy have moved close to 2 percent. indicators of longer term inflation expectations are little changed on balance.  consistent with its statutory mandate the committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. the committee expects that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity strong labor market conditions and inflation near the committee's symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term. risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced.  in view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation the committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1 3/4 to 2 percent. the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative thereby supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation.  in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate the committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. this assessment will take into account a wide range of information including measures of labor market conditions indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations and readings on financial and international developments.
