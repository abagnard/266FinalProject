actions implemented earlier year inevitable waning stimulative effects policy actions taken previous years need monetary restraint could ruled limited policy move point could reasonably expected view accomplish greater part committee anti inflationary objectives time would minimize risk setting policy overly restrictive course undesired consequences business expansion later moreover cautious approach could lessen risk committee policy intentions would misinterpreted resulting damage consumer business confidence dislocation financial markets despite reservations members indicated could accept degree restraint preferred majority quite small difference effects alternative moves economy time regard possible changes policy period next meeting majority members favored associating substantial policy adjustment symmetric intermeeting instruction preference based expectations policy action likely called near term although symmetric directive would prevent intermeeting adjustment near term developments differed substantially expectations one member expressed view unusually large move made especially important follow steady policy course period time undertake firming new
