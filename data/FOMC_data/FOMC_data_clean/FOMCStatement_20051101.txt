for immediate release the FOMC decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 4 percent elevated energy prices and hurricane related disruptions in economic activity have temporarily depressed output and employment however monetary policy accommodation coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity is providing ongoing support to economic activity that will likely be augmented by planned rebuilding in the hurricane affected areas the cumulative rise in energy and other costs has the potential to add to inflation pressures however core inflation has been relatively low in recent months and longer term inflation expectations remain contained the FOMC perceives that with appropriate monetary policy action the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal with underlying inflation expected to be contained the FOMC believes that policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured nonetheless the FOMC will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability
