overall employment coming quarters may possibly held notable declines construction employment adjustment labor force sector played slowing employment could occur conjunction strengthening productivity growth alternatively recent weakness measured productivity growth could reflect decline underlying trend productivity might persist although explanation might help account downshift measured
