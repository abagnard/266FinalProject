demand however improving balance sheet positions credit supply conditions lifting unusual constraint spending lower interest rates would encourage increases business fixed investment housing construction continued slack labor product markets coupled tempering inflation expectations expected foster reductions wage price inflation committee discussion economic outlook members commented economic data anecdotal reports received since september meeting tended reinforce earlier forecasts moderate economic expansion would sustained sluggish performance first half year overall economic activity picked somewhat third quarter members anticipated available indicators spending production pointed relatively robust economic growth current quarter looking ahead 1994 members expected expansion slow somewhat apparent pace closing months year fluctuations rate quarterly gdp growth undoubtedly would occur economy year ahead thought likely continue trend moderate expansion averaging close economy long run potential somewhat higher members saw probability sharp deviation either direction current forecasts relatively remote though number also believed deviation likely direction somewhat stronger rather weaker growth general members expected core inflation change little edge lower next year saw danger marginally higher inflation assessment developments underlying economic outlook members referred indications many areas strengthening business conditions related business sentiment though economic activity clearly remained sluggish even depressed parts country overall business attitudes could still described cautious current financial conditions including strength equity markets reduced intermediate long term interest rates apparently improving availability business credit financial institutions provided favorable backdrop economic expansion moreover businesses households made substantial progress improving financial positions factors seen reducing downside risks expansion time signs significant firming economic expansion number members observed point see usual indications near term intensification inflationary pressures general increases

durable goods contributed substantially strengthening economic expansion indications improving consumer confidence reflected turn growing optimism expressed business contacts regarding outlook holiday sales help sustain relatively ebullient consumer spending year end contacts motor vehicles industry also appeared relatively optimistic prospects sales new models outlook consumer sector also subject constraining influences growth consumer spending tended exceed expansion consumer incomes number members questioned extent acceleration spending likely extend new year saving rate already near low end historic range least basis current estimates unlikely decline significantly much would depend consumers outlook employment incomes growing demands eventually translated faster employment gains point business firms continued resist adding workforces despite increasing sales many firms still announcing workforce reductions net gains employment including growth associated increases self employment new business formations continuing expansion jobs consumer incomes probably would moderate pace year ahead background members generally expected moderate growth consumer spending maintained see spending likely give extra impetus growth economic activity 1994 members anticipated appreciable expansion business investment spending especially context reduced interest rates improved business balance sheets ongoing efforts improve productivity growth spending business equipment probably would continue relatively vigorous pace though perhaps somewhat growth rates experienced recent quarters

pronounced effect early months next year given retroactive inclusion 1993 incomes subject new tax members noted increased tax payments probably widely anticipated negative implications economy might well less many observers expected nonetheless overall posture fiscal policy associated business concerns cost implications possible future legislation likely important factor tending limit strength

among members ranged expectations limited progress toward price stability forecasts marginal increase core rate inflation members anticipated relatively favorable inflation performance tended underscore likely persistence appreciable slack labor production resources assumption growth overall economic activity would remain moderate trend line forecasts also pointed absence inflationary

possibility economic expansion next year especially turned high side range encompassing members current projections likely associated upward pressures costs prices connection relatively rapid growth economic activity persist early part next year probably would trigger attempts raise prices wages somewhat rapidly even context continuing slack overall capacity labor utilization point however significant indications accelerating inflation business contacts around nation currently see seem anticipate increasing inflationary pressures committee discussion policy intermeeting period ahead members generally agreed despite various indications pickup economic growth underlying economic situation outlook inflation changed sufficiently warrant adjustment monetary policy looking beyond intermeeting period however several members commented committee might well consider need move currently stimulative stance monetary policy toward neutral policy posture concerns rising inflationary pressures begin realized members recognized desirability taking early action arrest incipient inflationary pressures gathered strength especially given committee commitment resist greater inflation foster sustained progress toward price stability appropriate circumstances prompt policy move also might allay market concerns inflation favorable implications longer term interest rates performance interest sensitive sectors economy members acknowledged current measures inflation anecdotal reports around nation whole suggest intensification inflation point moreover committee wary misleading signals inherent saw tooth pattern typical economic expansions needed avoid policy move would incur unnecessary risk expansion given uncertainties degree recent strength spending would persist members concluded balance current economic conditions warranted steady policy course light prevailing uncertainties would premature anticipate particular policy change timing consequence members also concluded currently unbiased instruction directive relating direction possible intermeeting policy changes retained case significant changes outlook requiring policy action viewed unlikely relatively short period next scheduled meeting december 21 one member expressed differing view less accommodative policy would consistent time committee desire foster sustained economic expansion progress toward price stability however member also felt policy tightening move time might seen response stronger economy rather action clearly intended underscore committee commitment price stability therefore would elicit favorable response intermediate long term debt markets regard financial developments bearing economic outlook potential need adjust monetary policy members observed broader money credit aggregates strengthened somewhat since earlier year though still relatively moderate growth rates moreover much acceleration m2 m3 could attributed special temporary factors according staff analysis growth aggregates likely revert relatively slow rates coming months assuming unchanged reserve conditions time growth m1 reserves remained comparatively rapid one view growth might well indicative overly stimulative monetary policy would promote inflation time least prove inconsistent disinflation conclusion committee discussion members indicated support directive called maintaining existing
