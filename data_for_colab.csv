outlook future gains continuing assessment efficacy costs asset purchases might lead committee decide point change mix policy tools maintaining high degree accommodation another suggestion enhancing communications use summary economic projections provide information participants views general discussion policy strategy tactics participants reviewed issues specific committee asset purchase program

participants noted committee going contemplate cutting purchases future based criteria improvement labor market outlook concerns efficacy costs asset purchases would need communicate effectively criteria circumstances might well appropriate offset effects reduced purchases undertaking alternative actions provide accommodation time participants generally expressed reservations possibility introducing simple mechanical rule would adjust pace asset purchases automatically based single variable unemployment rate payroll employment open considering rule others viewed approach unlikely reliably produce appropriate policy outcomes alternative participants mentioned might preferable adopt even simpler plan announce total size remaining purchases timetable winding program calendar based step would run counter data dependent state contingent nature current asset purchase program would easier communicate might help public separate committee purchase program policy federal funds rate overall stance policy regard future reductions asset purchases participants discussed might split across asset classes number participants believed making roughly equal adjustments purchases treasury securities mbs would appropriate relatively straightforward communicate public however others indicated could back trimming pace treasury purchases rapidly mbs perhaps signal intention support mortgage markets one participant thought trimming mbs first would reduce potential distortions credit allocation part planning discussion participants also examined several possibilities clarifying strengthening forward guidance federal funds rate including providing additional information likely path rate either one economic thresholds current guidance reached funds rate target eventually raised current exceptionally low level couple participants favored simply reducing 6 1 2 percent unemployment rate threshold others noted change might raise concerns durability committee commitment thresholds participants also weighed merits stating even unemployment rate dropped 6 1 2 percent target federal funds rate would raised long inflation rate projected run given level general benefits adding kind quantitative floor inflation viewed uncertain likely rather modest communicating could present challenges participants remained favorably inclined toward several participants concluded providing additional qualitative information committee intentions regarding federal funds rate unemployment threshold reached could helpful guidance could indicate range information committee would consider evaluating would appropriate raise federal funds rate alternatively policy statement could indicate even first increase federal funds rate target committee anticipated keeping rate longer run equilibrium value time economic headwinds likely diminish slowly factors besides headwinds also mentioned possibly providing rationale maintaining low trajectory federal funds rate including following commitment support economy maintaining accommodative policy longer modifications forward guidance federal funds rate could implemented future either improve clarity add policy accommodation perhaps conjunction reduction pace asset purchases part rebalancing committee tools participants also discussed range possible actions could considered committee wished signal intention keep short term rates low reinforce forward guidance federal funds rate example participants thought reduction board governors interest rate paid excess reserves could worth considering stage although benefits step generally seen likely small except possibly signal policy intentions contrast participants expressed range concerns using open market operations aimed affecting expected path short term interest rates standing purchase facility shorter term treasury securities provision term funding repurchase agreements among concerns voiced operations would inhibit price discovery remove valuable

market stabilizer 8 assessing two approaches involved several considerations including degree assurance control federal funds rate likelihood participation federal reserve repo operations could become

participants estimates longer run normal level couple participants said would expected inflation slow noticeably substantial persistent slack one implication view relatively little slack providing monetary stimulus would likely raise inflation committee objective participants acknowledged structural factors contributing unemployment said view slack remained high weak aggregate demand major reason unemployment rate still elevated participants cited range evidence support judgment still high fraction workers report working part time jobs cannot find full time work research showing job finding rates among long term unemployed somewhat higher recent past year earlier anecdotal evidence effect employers see long spells unemployment making applicants less attractive jobs reports employers receiving large numbers applications opening especially discriminating filling vacant positions another participant pointed research showing many countries inflation less responsive downward pressure labor market slack inflation already low inflation elevated evidence firms united states reluctant cut nominal wages recent years indications sizable slack might cause inflation decline already low level arguments imply slack labor markets remains considerable therefore reduction unemployment rate toward longer run normal level would much effect inflation measures consumer price
