generally interpreted information became available intermeeting period suggesting economic growth would likely remain moderate coming quarters pick gradually participants saw incoming information indicating somewhat slower growth total demand output employment coming quarters projected april carried forward downward revision projections medium term growth however participants judged recent

unemployment rate would decline slowly number factors continued seen likely limit economic expansion moderate pace near term included slow growth even contraction major foreign economies ongoing prospective fiscal tightening united states modest growth household income despite recent signs improvement continued weakness housing sector april participants expected factors restraining economic expansion would ease time anticipated recovery eventually would gain strength however strains global financial markets stemmed primarily fiscal banking concerns europe become pronounced intermeeting period continued pose significant downside risks economic outlook possibility sharper anticipated fiscal tightening united states also posed downside risk looking beyond temporary effects inflation year fluctuations oil commodity prices almost participants continued anticipate inflation medium term would run 2 percent rate committee judges consistent statutory mandate one participant judgment appropriate monetary policy would lead inflation modestly greater 2 percent time order bring unemployment somewhat faster participants indicated saw persistent slack resource utilization posing downside risks outlook inflation participants judged highly accommodative stance monetary policy posed upside risks medium term inflation outlook discussing household sector meeting participants noted real personal consumption expenditures continued expand despite weak growth real disposable income pace expansion appeared slowed since earlier year participants expressed concern slow growth employment low levels consumer confidence would restrain consumer spending many participants however said business contacts reported consumer spending holding several observed recent declines gasoline prices would increase households real incomes could boost consumer spending coming quarters broadly improving household balance sheets diminishing drag household deleveraging seen likely help support rising household expenditures time indicators home sales construction prices suggested improvement housing sector however regions shared gains sector remained depressed overall participants anticipated housing markets likely recover slowly time part tight credit standards mortgage lending meant low mortgage rates generating less pickup home sales construction case recoveries earlier recessions participants sanguine potential sizable upturn housing activity still residential investment currently much smaller share real gdp past recoveries housing sector seemed unlikely contribute substantially stronger economic recovery anecdotal evidence business contacts indicated activity energy agriculture sectors continued advance recent months information manufacturing transportation firms generally less optimistic earlier year number reports slowing sales europe asia contacts parts country also indicated firms become cautious hiring investment decisions capital investment undertaken improve productivity reduce costs rather expand capacity participants cited examples business contacts saying heightened uncertainty future tax regulatory policies led put potential investment projects hold uncertainty resolved participants expected fiscal policy would continue drag economic growth coming quarters generally also saw federal budget situation downside risk economic outlook agreement reached address expiring tax cuts scheduled spending reductions current law sharp tightening fiscal policy would occur start 2013 participants reported hearing defense contractors making contingency plans reduce workforces potential spending cuts go effect one reported firms already begun make reductions contrast noted agreement credible longer term plan put federal budget sustainable path medium run way removes near term fiscal risks recovery would help alleviate uncertainty likely would positive effects consumer business sentiment could spur increase business investment hiring exports helped support u economic growth early months year however recent reports business contacts pointed slowing exports europe china several participants noted risk economic weakness europe significant slowing pace expansion emerging markets asia could damp exports couple participants expressed view direct effects u economy stemming slower economic growth abroad effects

labor market conditions diminished recent months particular growth employment slowed job growth late last year early year boosted unusually mild winter weather slowing expected weather became normal spring reported slowing substantial many participants anticipated one participant noted apparent tension strong employment growth moderate output growth seen earlier year resolved recently slower job growth rather faster output growth even average monthly growth payrolls january may line last year pace meeting participants discussed extent slack labor markets participants judged unemployment rate substantially boosted structural factors mismatches skills unemployed workers required available jobs view would imply less slack labor markets suggested simple comparison current unemployment rate participants estimates longer run normal level couple participants said would expected inflation slow noticeably substantial persistent slack one implication view relatively little slack providing monetary stimulus would likely raise inflation committee objective participants acknowledged structural factors contributing unemployment said view slack remained high weak aggregate demand major reason unemployment rate still elevated participants cited range evidence support judgment still high fraction workers report working part time jobs cannot find full time work research showing job finding rates among long term unemployed somewhat higher recent past year earlier anecdotal evidence effect employers see long spells unemployment making applicants less attractive jobs reports employers receiving large numbers applications opening especially discriminating filling vacant positions another participant pointed research showing many countries inflation less responsive downward pressure labor market slack inflation already low inflation elevated evidence firms united states reluctant cut nominal wages recent years indications sizable slack might cause inflation decline already low level arguments imply slack labor markets remains considerable therefore reduction unemployment rate toward longer run normal level would much effect inflation measures consumer price inflation declined intermeeting period mainly reflecting reductions oil gasoline prices since earlier year several participants noted saw little evidence price pressures commenting increases labor costs continued subdued non energy commodity prices declined late longer run inflation expectations well anchored unemployment rate elevated almost participants anticipated inflation coming quarters medium run would 2 percent rate committee judges consistent mandate several revised inflation forecasts participants viewed risks inflation outlook roughly balanced participants however saw persistent slack resource utilization weighting risks outlook inflation downside contrast saw inflation risks tilted upside generally skeptical models rely economic slack forecast inflation concerned maintaining current highly accommodative stance monetary policy medium run risked eroding stability inflation expectations couple noting large long run fiscal imbalances also posed risk many fomc participants judged overall financial conditions become somewhat less supportive growth demand goods services investors concerns sovereign debt banking situation euro area reportedly intensified intermeeting period leading higher risk spreads lower prices riskier assets including equities broad based appreciation u dollar foreign exchange markets contrast participants observed marked drop yields longer term u treasury securities could provide impetus growth focusing narrowly banking sector united states noted measures credit quality bank loans generally continued improve bank capital levels quite high banks ample liquidity consumer business loans increasing although credit standards remained tight commercial residential real estate lending relatively weak participants indicated seeing signs low interest rates might inducing investors take imprudent risks search higher nominal returns participants discussed risk strains global financial markets pressures european financial institutions
