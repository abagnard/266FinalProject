discussion policy intermeeting period ahead members supported move toward less accommodative policy stance initial move direction made early february members still viewed monetary policy stimulative regard members cited low inflation adjusted interest rates short term debt markets indicator excessive policy accommodation one member also referred rapid growth reserves narrow measures money extended period quite accommodative policy stance entirely appropriate earlier economic recovery constraints widespread rebuilding balance sheets business restructuring activities strongly inhibiting

outbreak inflation circumstances members concluded monetary policy needed move fairly quickly toward might characterized neutral position policy posture could defined precision undoubtedly varied
