information received since the FOMC met in october suggests that economic activity and employment have continued to expand at a moderate pace in recent months apart from weather related disruptions although the unemployment rate has declined somewhat since the summer it remains elevated household spending has continued to advance and the housing sector has shown further signs of improvement but growth in business fixed investment has slowed inflation has been running somewhat below the FOMC s longer run objective apart from temporary variations that largely reflect fluctuations in energy prices longer term inflation expectations have remained stable consistent with its statutory mandate the FOMC seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability the FOMC remains concerned that without sufficient policy accommodation economic growth might not be strong enough to generate sustained improvement in labor market conditions furthermore strains in global financial markets continue to pose significant downside risks to the economic outlook the FOMC also anticipates that inflation over the medium term likely will run at or below its 2 percent objective to support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation over time is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate the FOMC will continue purchasing additional agency mortgage backed securities at a pace of 40 billion per month the FOMC also will purchase longer term treasury securities after its program to extend the average maturity of its holdings of treasury securities is completed at the end of the year initially at a pace of 45 billion per month the FOMC is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities in agency mortgage backed securities and in january will resume rolling over maturing treasury securities at auction taken together these actions should maintain downward pressure on longer term interest rates support mortgage markets and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative the FOMC will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months if the outlook for the labor market does not improve substantially the FOMC will continue its purchases of treasury and agency mortgage backed securities and employ its other policy tools as appropriate until such improvement is achieved in a context of price stability in determining the size pace and composition of its asset purchases the FOMC will as always take appropriate account of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases to support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability the FOMC expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens in particular the FOMC decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1 4 percent and currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6 1 2 percent inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the FOMC s 2 percent longer run goal and longer term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored the FOMC views these thresholds as consistent with its earlier date based guidance in determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy the FOMC will also consider other information including additional measures of labor market conditions indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations and readings on financial developments when the FOMC decides to begin to remove policy accommodation it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent
