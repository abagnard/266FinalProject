relatively subdued signs price data picking however risks rise inflation road increased appreciably result strength aggregate demand increase pressures resources likely would accompany absent firming financial conditions discussion outlook spending key sectors economy members emphasized strength consumer spending recent months noted anecdotal reports numerous parts country surveys indicating high

consumers also responding increasingly run household net worth stemming earlier buoyant performance stock market effects rising financial wealth consumer spending difficult isolate undoubtedly restrained efforts accumulate savings future expenditures college expenses retirement moreover constraints spending imposed high debt burdens many households tended exert least partly offsetting influence overall consumer spending balance however members believed consumer sector likely provide major ongoing support expansion though increases consumer spending probably would diminish context restrained growth jobs incomes number members expressed view however risks forecast direction robust consumer spending business fixed investment remained steep uptrend extended period also expected

consistent slightly declining trend price inflation even prospects substantial period economic expansion rate exceeded estimated growth potential generated increasing concerns rising inflationary pressures economy already operating high levels resource utilization members observed regard little evidence growing demand pressures capital resources tightness labor markets appeared intensifying indications development included widespread anecdotal reports variety data initial claims insured unemployment help wanted advertising rise labor force participation high percentage working age population helped keep unemployment rate falling unexpected increase participation suggesting tight conditions inducing marginal workers job market data worker compensation somewhat mixed suggested acceleration balance members noted damping effects temporary factors labor costs could well begin wane soon already begun included possibility job security concerns might diminishing extended period rapid job growth low unemployment downward trend medical cost increases might process shifting flat rising gradient according informed observers moreover rise labor force participation depleted pool available workers less productive workers would tend hired adverse effects productivity costs members recognized even though aggregate demand pressures seemed pressing increasingly available producer resources possible forecast confidence period favorable price behavior would end even clear inflationary developments economy become matter urgent concern monetary policy light concern committee discussion policy intermeeting period ahead members supported could accept proposal adjust policy toward slightly less accommodative stance move symmetry directive noted continued relatively rapid growth economic activity first quarter suggested greater persisting strength demand anticipated resource use already high levels rapid growth risked greater pressures resources rising inflation although inflation remained remarkably subdued increase inflationary pressures likely would tend emerge slowly strength demand developed backdrop financial conditions broadly considered substantially different prevailing situation saw clear need preemptive policy action would head pickup inflation noted shift tighter policy stance would seem pose little risk expansion indeed countering tendency inflation rise higher inflation expectations become embedded financial markets economic decision making generally action would help head abrupt economic slowing even downturn thereby would help sustain expansion preserve firm labor markets associated benefits members argued substantial tightening needed juncture provide better calibrated response persisting strength economy related risk intensifying inflationary pressures view vigorous action would lessen need tightening future also would foster financial setting would conducive sustained expansion members acknowledged smaller policy move would less effect curbing inflationary pressures felt cautious approach policy desirable time outlook economic activity inflation remained subject substantial uncertainties noted shift policy direction committee undertake often exaggerated effects financial markets making difficult judge much additional restraint might needed discussion possible adjustments policy intermeeting period majority members favored symmetric directive additional policy tightening might needed point appear likely developments intermeeting period would require policy move added inflation remained quiescent near term onset appreciable slowing expansion rate line economy potential could ruled accordingly felt directive establish presumption near term policy tightening members believed growth economy likely slow enough alleviate excess demands resources additional tightening would needed sooner rather later moderate inflationary pressures prolong expansion view outlook called vigilance maintenance asymmetric directive bias toward tightening could accept symmetric directive careful monitoring new developments signs need prompt action conclusion committee discussion members indicated supported could accept directive called slight increase degree pressure reserve positions include presumption adjustments policy intermeeting period accordingly context committee long run objectives price
