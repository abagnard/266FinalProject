market functioning ways asset purchases might amplify reduce risks financial stability fiscal implications purchases discussion topic meeting participants generally judged macroeconomic benefits current purchase program outweigh likely costs risks agreed ongoing assessment benefits costs necessary pointing academic federal reserve staff research participants saw asset purchases meaningful effect easing financial conditions supporting economic growth expressed view effects likely stronger federal reserve initial large scale asset purchases program also helped support market functioning financial crisis participants however saw little evidence efficacy asset purchases declined time couple suggested effectiveness purchases might even increased recently easing credit constraints allowed borrowers take advantage lower interest rates one participant emphasized role recent asset purchases keeping inflation declining committee longer run goal participants felt mbs purchases provided support economy purchases longer term treasury securities stimulated housing sector directly however preferred focus purchases treasury market avoid allocating credit specific sector economy noted addition standard channels monetary policy affects economy asset purchases could help signal committee commitment accommodative monetary policy thereby making forward guidance federal funds rate effective however participants convinced benefits asset purchases stating effects financial markets appeared short lived saw little evidence significant macroeconomic effect one participant suggested signaling effect asset purchases may reduced adoption threshold based forward guidance general reflecting limited experience large scale asset purchases participants recognized estimates economic effects necessarily imprecise covered wide range participants generally agreed asset purchases also potential costs risks particular participants pointed possible risks stability financial system functioning particular financial markets smooth withdrawal monetary accommodation eventually becomes appropriate federal reserve net income views practical importance risks varied prescriptions mitigating asset purchases seen potential contribute imbalances financial markets asset prices could undermine financial stability time moreover extent asset purchases push longer term interest rates potentially expose financial markets rapid rise rates future could impose significant losses investors intermediaries several participants suggested enhanced supervision could serve limit least extent increased risk taking associated lengthy period low long term interest rates effective policy communication balance sheet management committee could reduce probability excessively rapid increases longer term rates also noted accommodative stance policy could supporting financial stability returning economy stable footing sooner would otherwise case perhaps allowing borrowers secure longer term financing thereby reduce funding risks contrast curtailing asset purchases could slow recovery extend period low interest rates nevertheless number participants remained concerned potential financial stability risks build one consequence asset purchases increase federal reserve net income remittances treasury values projected decline perhaps even zero time committee eventually withdraws policy accommodation participants concerned substantial decline remittances might lead adverse public reaction potentially undermine federal reserve credibility effectiveness possibility outcomes seen necessitating clear communications outlook federal reserve net income several participants stated risks inhibit committee pursuing mandated objectives inflation employment case indicated fiscal benefits stronger economy would much greater short term fluctuations remittances moreover couple participants noted cumulative remittances treasury would likely higher would case without asset purchases participants also concerned additional asset purchases could complicate eventual firming policy example impairing committee control federal funds rate participants raised possibility undesirable rise inflation however others expressed confidence committee exit tools resolve keep inflation near longer run goal another exit related concern possible adverse effect market functioning mbs sales normalization federal reserve balance sheet although committee asset purchases little apparent effect securities market functioning date participants felt future asset sales could prove challenging regard several participants noted decision committee hold mbs maturity instead selling would essentially eliminate risk decision sell mbs sell mbs slowly would also mitigate financial stability risks could associated sales well damp decline remittances treasury time decision also seen potential source additional near term policy accommodation overall meeting participants thought risks costs additional asset purchases remained manageable also continued close attention issues warranted participants noted curtailing purchase program direct way mitigate costs risks light
