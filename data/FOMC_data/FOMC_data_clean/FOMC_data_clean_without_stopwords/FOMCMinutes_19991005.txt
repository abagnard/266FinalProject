tightening move november meeting action seem warranted time issue tilt committee directive majority members favored associating unchanged policy stance directive biased toward restraint members anticipate intermeeting developments would require policy tightened weeks immediately ahead believed committee probably would need move less accommodative policy stance relatively near future possibly november meeting also believed given committee recently adopted practice immediately announcing decisions change symmetry directive asymmetrical directive would help convey message policy adjustments might yet completed balance year committee remained concerned potential inflationary developments coming months members generally agreeing risks pointed balance rise inflation time nonetheless quite uncertain timing additional firming monetary policy preferred leave committee possible future course action open even could accept asymmetric directive light consensus emerged meeting favor unchanged policy stance regard committee announcement decision adopt asymmetric directive members observed recent practice making announcements led misinterpretations committee intentions seemed added volatility financial markets consequence committee members briefly considered alternative treatments symmetry disclosure meeting committee begun process examining wording directive announcement policy
