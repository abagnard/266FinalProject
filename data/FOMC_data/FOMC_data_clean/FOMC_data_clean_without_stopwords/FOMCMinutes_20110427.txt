prior notice intention terminate participation staff next gave presentation strategies normalizing stance conduct monetary policy time economy strengthens normalizing stance policy would entail withdrawal current extraordinary degree accommodation appropriate time normalizing conduct policy would involve draining large volume reserve balances banking system shrinking overall size balance sheet well returning soma historical composition essentially treasury securities presentation noted key issues committee would need address deciding approach normalization first key issue extent committee would want tighten policy appropriate time increasing short term interest rates decreasing holdings longer term securities two policies would restrain economic activity tightening financial conditions could combined various ways achieve similar outcomes example principle committee could accomplish essentially degree monetary tightening selling assets sooner faster raising target federal funds rate later slowly selling assets later slowly increasing federal funds rate target sooner faster soma portfolio could reduced selling securities outright ceasing reinvestment principal payments securities holdings second key issue extent committee might choose vary pace asset sales undertakes response economic financial conditions chose make pace sales quite responsive conditions fomc would able actively use two policy instruments asset sales federal funds rate target pursue economic objectives could increase scope flexibility adjusting financial conditions contrast sales pace varied less changes economic financial conditions preannounced largely predetermined would leave federal funds rate target committee primary active policy instrument could result policy straightforward committee calibrate communicate finally staff presentation noted committee would need decide use tools developed temporarily reduce reserve balances reverse repurchase agreements term deposits order tighten correspondence changes interest rate federal reserve pays excess reserves changes federal funds rate meeting participants agreed several principles would guide committee strategy normalizing monetary policy first regard normalization stance monetary policy pace sequencing policy steps would driven committee monetary policy objectives maximum employment price stability participants noted committee decision discuss appropriate strategy normalizing stance policy current meeting mean move toward normalization would necessarily begin soon second normalize conduct monetary policy agreed size soma securities portfolio would reduced intermediate term level consistent implementation monetary policy management federal funds rate rather variation size composition federal reserve balance sheet third intermediate term exit strategy would involve returning soma holding essentially treasury securities order minimize extent federal reserve portfolio might affect allocation credit across sectors economy shift seen requiring sales agency securities point fourth asset sales would implemented within framework communicated public advance pace potentially could adjusted response changes economic financial conditions addition nearly participants indicated first step toward normalization ceasing reinvest payments principal agency securities simultaneously soon ceasing reinvest principal payments treasury securities participants viewed halting reinvestments way begin gradually reduce size balance sheet noted however ending reinvestments would constitute modest step toward policy tightening implying decision made context economic outlook committee policy objectives addition changes statement language regarding forward policy guidance would need accompany normalization process participants expressed range views aspects normalization strategy participants indicated asset sales became appropriate sales put largely predetermined preannounced path however many participants noted pace sales could nonetheless adjusted response material changes economic outlook several participants preferred instead pace sales key policy tool varied actively response changes outlook majority participants preferred sales agency securities come first increase fomc target short term interest rates many participants also expressed preference sales proceed relatively gradually returning soma composition treasury securities perhaps five years participants noted given degree policy tightening gradual sales commenced later normalization process would allow earlier increase federal funds rate target effective lower bound would case asset sales commenced earlier rapid pace result committee would later option easing policy interest rate cut economic conditions warranted earlier increase federal funds rate also mentioned helpful limit potential low level rate encourage financial imbalances participants expressed preference sales begin increase federal funds rate target participants indicated sales increases federal funds rate target commence time participants favored earlier sales also generally indicated preference relatively rapid sales suggesting agency securities soma reduced zero little one two years approach viewed allowing faster return normal policy environment potentially reducing upside risks inflation stemming outsized reserve balances quickly eliminating effects soma holdings agency securities allocation credit participants saw changes target federal funds rate preferred active tool tightening monetary policy appropriate number participants noted would advisable begin using temporary reserves draining tools advance increase committee federal funds rate target part would put federal reserve better position assess effectiveness draining tools judge size draining operations might required support changes interest excess reserves ioer rate implementing desired increase short term rates number participants also noted would prepared sell securities sooner temporary reserves draining operations end reinvestment principal payments sufficient support fairly tight link increases ioer rate increases short term market interest rates discussion normalization participants also noted preferences longer run framework monetary policy implementation participants indicated preferred monetary policy eventually operate corridor type system federal funds rate trades middle range ioer rate floor discount rate ceiling range opposed floor type system relatively high level reserve balances keeps federal funds rate near ioer rate couple participants noted normalization strategy would likely involve elevated balance sheet federal funds rate target near ioer rate floor type systems time therefore committee would accumulate experience process normalizing policy would allow make informed choice regarding longer term framework later date committee agreed discussion issues needed decisions regarding
