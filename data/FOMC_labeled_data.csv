3,2000-10-03,minutes,indexes of stock market prices declined somewhat over the intermeeting period in foreign exchange markets the trade weighted value of the dollar increased somewhat further on balance in terms of an index of major foreign currencies the dollar s net appreciation against the euro occurred despite a small policy tightening by the ecb on august 31 as sentiment toward that currency remained negative in part because of concerns about capital flows out of the euro area the major industrial countries undertook joint foreign exchange intervention late in the period on september 22 to stem the euro s slide the intervention was at the initiative of the ecb and was joined by the united states and other nations because of shared concern about the potential implications of recent movements in the euro the dollar also posted gains against the currencies of a number of other important trading partners notably the brazilian real and the mexican peso the broad monetary aggregates had expanded relatively briskly in recent months the growth of m2 perhaps reflecting the recent vigor of consumer spending picked up considerably in august and september after having increased slowly in june and july averaged across the past four months however m2 increased at a pace noticeably below that of earlier in the year with the slowdown partly reflecting a lagged response to a widening during the first half of the year of the opportunity costs of holding m2 assets m3 expansion remained robust in august and september though somewhat below the pace in the first half of the year the growth of domestic nonfinancial debt slowed somewhat in july and august in association with some moderation in the brisk pace of private borrowing that was offset in part by a less rapid paydown of federal debt the staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the economic expansion after slowing considerably from its elevated pace of recent quarters would be sustained at a rate a little below the staff s current estimate of the economy s potential output the forecast anticipated that the expansion of domestic final demand would be held back to some extent by the eventual disappearance of positive wealth effects associated with outsized earlier gains in equity prices and by higher interest rates as a result growth of spending on consumer durables was expected to remain appreciably below that in recent quarters and housing demand would trend,though previous policy tightening actions yet exerted full restraining effects members emphasized however unusually

some favorable signs were evident economic activity in the developing countries also picked up further with asian countries registering the largest gains price inflation had remained moderate in recent months with the exception of higher energy prices consumer prices jumped in february as energy prices surged abstracting from energy prices however consumer price inflation was moderate in january and february moreover the increase in consumer prices of items other than food and energy during the twelve months ended in february was the same as the change during the previous twelve month period at the producer level prices of finished goods other than food and energy changed little in january and february and their rise during the twelve months ended in february was somewhat smaller than the advance during the previous twelve month period at earlier stages of processing however producer prices registered somewhat larger increases than those for finished goods in both the january february period and the twelve months ended in february with regard to labor costs average hourly earnings grew at a slightly faster rate in january and february than they had in the fourth quarter of last year however the advance in this earnings measure in the twelve months ended in february was about the same as that in the previous twelve month period at its meeting on february 1 2 2000 the FOMC adopted a directive that called for a slight tightening of conditions in reserve markets consistent with an increase of ¼ percentage point in the federal funds rate to an average of about 5 3 4 percent the members agreed that this action was needed to help bring the growth of aggregate demand into better alignment with the expansion of potential aggregate supply and thereby help avert rising inflationary pressures the members also agreed that the risks remained weighted mainly in the direction of greater inflation pressures and that further tightening actions might be necessary to bring about financial conditions that were sufficiently firm to contain upward pressures on labor costs and prices open market operations during the intermeeting period were directed toward implementing the desired slightly greater pressure on reserve positions and the federal funds rate averaged very close to the FOMC s 5 3 4 percent target,nonresidential structures turned last autumn rose rapidly

7,2011-01-26,minutes,underlying inflation such as the trimmed mean and median cpis also remained subdued despite the steep run up in agricultural commodity prices over the second half of last year increases in retail food prices remained modest however consumer energy prices moved up sharply in december and prices of most types of crude oil increased during december and into january the prices of nonfuel industrial commodities also continued to rise over the intermeeting period in december and early january survey measures of households long term inflation expectations stayed in the range that has prevailed for some time available measures of labor compensation showed that labor cost pressures were still restrained as wage increases slowed along with inflation and productivity gains appeared to remain substantial the 12 month change in average hourly earnings for all employees continued to be low in december the u s international trade deficit narrowed slightly in november as both nominal exports and imports moved up by almost the same amount the increase in exports was driven by agricultural goods in part reflecting higher prices as well as by consumer goods in contrast exports of machinery and automotive products fell reversing their october gains the rise in imports reflected an increase in the value of imported petroleum products mostly explained by higher prices and of capital goods which was supported importantly by a jump in computers at the same time noticeable decreases were registered for imports of automotive products services and consumer goods which were primarily due to pharmaceuticals these developments combined with the substantial narrowing in the trade deficit in october implied that the trade deficit likely shrank considerably in the fourth quarter of 2010 recent indicators of foreign economic activity suggested that the global recovery was strengthening much of this strength was centered in the emerging market economies emes where widespread increases in exports and in manufacturing purchasing managers indexes pmis pointed to a resurgence in economic growth following a slowdown in the third quarter of 2010 for china and

9,2002-11-06,minutes,robust recovery could not be ruled out in the absence of further major shocks to confidence with pressures on labor and other resources expected to be limited over coming quarters inflation was likely to remain subdued and perhaps even to edge a little lower in their review of developments and prospects in key expenditure sectors of the economy members noted that consumer spending appeared to have decelerated since midsummer while an anticipated and hopefully compensating strengthening in business investment had not yet materialized factors cited by the members that appeared to help account for the recent softness in consumer demand included substantial decreases in equity wealth declining consumer confidence in the context of geopolitical and other uncertainties the waning effects of earlier income tax cuts and the failure of the most recent round of motor vehicle sales incentives to maintain the extraordinary level of sales seen during the summer looking ahead some members referred to subdued expectations among their retailer contacts regarding the upcoming holiday season with sales prospects likely to be held back at least marginally by the lingering effects of the recent west coast dock strike on the availability of merchandise there also was some question as to whether funds extracted from rising home equity values would continue to provide as important a source of financing for purchases of consumer durables as they had for some time unless mortgage interest rates declined from their already low levels members also mentioned a number of favorable factors bearing on the longer term outlook for consumer spending these included the prospect of strengthening consumer confidence if geopolitical uncertainties began to dissipate the gradual diminution of the negative wealth effects from earlier stock market declines and importantly the outlook for continued robust growth in structural labor productivity and its favorable effects over time on wages and salaries high and persisting uncertainty and concomitant aversion to risk among business executives apparently continued to hold down business investment spending while such expenditures remained at a high level members saw few signs of a significant pickup in the nearer term apart from notably adverse business sentiment and disappointing growth in sales and profits factors that were curbing capital expenditures cited by members included persisting capital overhangs stemming from what were now seen as excessive earlier buildups in equipment and software and substantial idle capacity in many industrial and commercial structures some divergence of opinion was,eliminated business capital stocks moved closer desired levels consequence slowly improving

10,1997-09-30,minutes,rate well above the upper bound of its range total domestic nonfinancial debt continued to increase at a relatively moderate rate in recent months the staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the economy would expand at a pace significantly above that anticipated earlier for the second half of the year and the early part of 1998 but economic growth was likely to moderate appreciably to a more sustainable rate later in the near term business fixed investment appeared to be providing surprisingly strong impetus to income growth and rising levels of wealth were stimulating robust consumer demand with sales so strong the downward adjustment in inventory investment that had been anticipated in the previous staff forecast seemed likely to occur more gradually the projected strength in aggregate demand appeared likely to intensify pressures on resources and lead to some pickup in inflation less accommodative financial market conditions were anticipated to damp these tendencies over time in the FOMC s discussion of current and prospective economic developments members commented on the continued remarkable performance of the economy strength in consumer spending and further acceleration in capital investment sparked faster than expected growth in the third quarter and relatively brisk economic expansion seemed to be in prospect for a period ahead in the context of very positive business and consumer sentiment strong demands for capital goods and favorable financial conditions the rate of expansion might subsequently be expected to slow as stocks of business capital and consumer durable goods built up relative to sales and incomes inventory investment moderated somewhat and the recent strength of the dollar began to exert a drag on exports it was an open question however as to whether these influences would be sufficient to slow the growth of demands for goods and services to a more sustainable pace and many members suggested that the risks to the forecast were on the side of increases in final demands that would press more intensely against the available resources despite high levels of resource utilization inflation and inflationary expectations had remained subdued to date reflecting to some extent special influences like the rise in the foreign exchange value of the dollar moreover sizable gains in productivity

11,2002-09-24,minutes,spending projects and perhaps the improved tone in the corporate bond market and a modest increase in the issuance of corporate debt the staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that in light of weaker than expected incoming economic data the expansion of economic activity would pick up more gradually but would still reach a relatively brisk pace late next year the considerable monetary ease and fiscal stimulus already in place continuing gains in structural productivity and improving business confidence would provide significant impetus for spending inventory overhangs appeared to have been largely eliminated and business capital stocks appeared to have moved closer to desired levels as a consequence a gradually improving outlook for sales and profits low financing costs and the temporary federal tax incentive for investment in new equipment and software were expected to boost business investment spending however a less robust pickup in final sales was now expected over the forecast period which would put somewhat less pressure on resource margins than had been anticipated previously and the level of activity would remain below that of the economy s potential for a longer time the persistence of underutilized resources was expected to foster some moderation in core price inflation in the FOMC s discussion of current and prospective economic conditions members commented that economic growth appeared to have picked up in the third quarter but that the most recent information had been mixed raising questions about whether the pace of the expansion going forward would be strong enough to erode margins of underutilized labor and capital resources for now a high degree of business caution in the context of substantial uncertainties exacerbated recently by apparently increased concerns about the geopolitical outlook continued to restrain business investment and hiring even so the economy appeared to be well positioned for solid gains over time in light of the progress that had been made in bringing inventories and capital stocks into better alignment with sales the stimulus provided by accommodative fiscal and monetary policies and the implications of the strong uptrend in productivity for profitable investment opportunities and growth in consumer incomes with the growth of economic activity nonetheless expected to

the economy was expanding at a moderate pace a number of participants mentioned that they were encouraged by the apparent resilience of private spending so far this year despite considerable downward

18,2003-06-25,minutes,a substantial further decline in inflation was viewed as having a low probability though disinflation would remain a matter of concern until a sustained pickup in overall economic activity was firmly established in preparation for the midyear monetary policy report to congress the members of the board of governors and the presidents of the federal reserve banks submitted individual projections of the growth of gdp the rate of unemployment and the rate of inflation for the years 2003 and 2004 the members based these forecasts on their individual views as to the appropriate path of policy over the projection period and had the opportunity to update them until july 3 the forecasts of the rate of expansion in real gdp had central tendencies of 2 1 2 to 2 3 4 percent for 2003 implying that economic growth would accelerate noticeably in the second half of the year and 3 3 4 to 4 3 4 percent for 2004 these rates of growth were associated with central tendencies for the civilian rate of unemployment of 6 to 6 1 4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2003 and 5 1 2 to 6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2004 forecasts of inflation as measured by the chain type price index for personal consumption expenditures pointed to the persistence of quite low inflation rates centered on ranges of 1 1 4 to 1 1 2 percent for this year and 1 to 1 1 2 percent in 2004 despite some differences with regard to the timing and strength of the anticipated upturn in the expansion the members agreed that accommodative monetary and fiscal policies along with much improved financial conditions were likely to foster a better economic performance over time growing market perceptions that monetary policy would remain stimulative for a longer period than previously anticipated appeared to have contributed to significant declines in interest rates across maturities and risk classes and to rising prices in equity markets the gains in equity prices and a narrowing of risk spreads also appeared to reflect more upbeat assessments of underlying business conditions and partly in concert with reduced geopolitical risks since the end of major military activity in iraq growing convictions that the downside vulnerability of the domestic economy had diminished both business firms and households had continued to take advantage of generally improving financial

19,1998-11-17,minutes,spreads had narrowed substantially and other measures of financial market performance also suggested that risk aversion and the related desire for liquidity had diminished appreciably markets for new issues had reopened for many borrowers and stock market prices had posted large gains nonetheless strains and weaknesses in financial markets had not disappeared many risk spreads were still at unusually high levels and the markets remained quite sensitive to unanticipated developments members also noted that the improvement in debt markets appeared to have come to a halt most recently and indeed that renewed strains had emerged in some short term debt markets though the latter probably were related in large measure to concerns about year end pressures in the money markets indeed efforts by lenders and borrowers to position for year end financial statements were likely to contribute considerably to keeping market conditions unsettled over coming weeks lending activity at banks had increased sharply in recent months as many borrowers found other sources of funds less receptive or unavailable and turned to backup lines for credit but banks also had tightened their credit terms and standards for most new loans and lines of credit as a result financing generally had become less available and more expensive for higher risk business borrowers in light of these developments members believed that the continuing fragility of financial markets and the increased scrutiny of the credit quality of borrowers though the latter was in some respects a welcome development posed a considerable downside risk to the expansion the very recent behavior of equity prices was difficult to explain satisfactorily and potential movements in those prices posed risks on both sides of the most likely forecast a future substantial increase would bolster wealth and spending but a sharp decline also could not be ruled out especially if as seemed quite possible added increases in prices were not supported by robust increases in profits foreign economic and financial developments were another important source of downside risk and uncertainty the economic and financial turmoil in asia had spread to numerous other nations around the world and to an extent to the united states while economic weakness in many u s trading partners likely would continue to have adverse effects on net u s exports the potential extent of such weakness was subject to considerable uncertainty as were the associated repercussions on financial markets as they had at

commitment to achieving that objective several participants indicated that they viewed the available evidence as suggesting that longer run inflation expectations remained well anchored one cited recent research finding that inflation expectations had become better anchored following the FOMC s adoption of a numerical inflation target however a few saw low levels of inflation over recent years as reflecting in part slippage in longer run inflation expectations below the FOMC s 2 percent objective in that regard a number of participants noted the importance of continuing to emphasize that the FOMC s 2 percent inflation objective is symmetric a couple of participants suggested that the FOMC might consider expressing its objective as a range rather than a point estimate a few other participants suggested that the fomc could begin to examine whether adopting a monetary policy framework in which the FOMC would strive to make up for past deviations of inflation from target might address the challenge of achieving and maintaining inflation expectations consistent with the FOMC s inflation objective particularly in an environment in which the neutral rate of interest appeared

computers and other high tech equipment just in advance of the century rollover the weakness in the nonresidential sector was evidenced by further declines in construction outlays and new building

27,2012-03-13,minutes,in 2012 and 2013 participants views on current conditions and the economic outlook in their discussion of the economic situation and outlook meeting participants agreed that the information received since the FOMC s previous meeting while mixed had been positive on balance and suggested that the economy had been expanding moderately labor market conditions had improved further payroll employment had continued to expand and the unemployment rate had declined notably in recent months still unemployment remained elevated household spending and business fixed investment had continued to advance despite signs of improvement or stabilization in some local housing markets most participants agreed that the housing sector remained depressed inflation had been subdued in recent months although prices of crude oil and gasoline had increased of late longer term inflation expectations had remained stable and most meeting participants saw little evidence of cost pressures with respect to the economic outlook participants generally saw the intermeeting news as suggesting that economic growth over coming quarters would continue to be moderate and that the unemployment rate would decline gradually toward levels that the FOMC judges to be consistent with its dual mandate while a few participants indicated that their expectations for real gdp growth for 2012 had risen somewhat most participants did not interpret the recent economic and financial information as pointing to a material revision to the outlook for 2013 and 2014 financial conditions had improved notably since the january meeting equity prices were higher and risk spreads had declined nonetheless a number of factors continued to be seen as likely to restrain the pace of economic expansion these included slower growth in some foreign economies prospective fiscal tightening in the united states the weak housing market further household deleveraging and high levels of uncertainty among households and businesses participants continued to expect most of the factors restraining economic expansion to ease over time and so anticipated that the recovery would gradually gain strength in addition participants noted that recent policy actions in the euro area had helped reduce financial stresses and lower downside risks in the short term however increased volatility in financial markets remained a possibility if measures to address the longer term fiscal and banking issues in the euro area were not put in place in a timely fashion inflation had been subdued of late although

real output growth the unemployment rate inflation and the target federal funds rate for each year from 2012 through 2014 and over the longer run under each participant s judgment of appropriate monetary policy the longer run projections represent each participant s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge over time under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy these economic projections and policy assessments are described in the summary of economic projections which is attached as an addendum to these minutes in their discussion of the economic situation and outlook participants agreed that the information received since the FOMC s previous meeting suggested that the economy had continued to expand moderately though many noted that a variety of indicators showed smaller gains than had been anticipated growth in employment in particular appeared to have slowed in recent months and the unemployment rate remained elevated business fixed investment had continued to advance and household spending appeared to be rising at a somewhat slower pace than earlier in the year there were further signs of improvement in the housing sector but the level of activity remained very low volatility in financial markets increased over the intermeeting period and investors appetite for riskier assets declined likely in response to heightened fiscal and financial strains in europe as well as some weaker than expected incoming data about the u s economy and foreign economies inflation had slowed somewhat mainly reflecting the decline in the prices of crude oil and gasoline in recent months and longer term inflation expectations remained stable participants generally interpreted the information that became available during the intermeeting period as suggesting that economic growth would most likely remain moderate over coming quarters and then pick up very gradually most participants saw the incoming information as indicating somewhat slower growth in total demand output and employment over coming quarters than they had projected in april and most carried forward some of that downward revision to their projections of medium term growth however some participants judged that the recent weakness in a variety of economic indicators was more likely to prove transitory and thought that

32,2002-08-13,minutes,expansion of economic activity would pick up gradually over the next year and a half from the very sluggish pace of the second quarter the considerable monetary ease and fiscal stimulus already in place and the continuing sizable gains in structural productivity would provide significant impetus for spending though the persisting volatility and weakness in equity prices would tend to offset some of that support inventory overhangs appeared to have been largely eliminated and business capital stocks to have moved closer to desired levels as a consequence a gradually improving outlook for sales and profits low financing costs and the temporary federal tax incentive for investment in new equipment and software were expected to boost business investment spending however a less robust pickup in final sales was now expected over the forecast period which would put somewhat less pressure on resource margins than had been anticipated previously and the level of activity would remain below the economy s potential for a somewhat longer time the persistence of underutilized resources was expected to foster some moderation in core price inflation in the FOMC s discussion of current and prospective economic developments members commented that much of the incoming information on economic activity had been disappointing and many indicated that they had marked down their growth forecasts for the months ahead even so with recent weakness concentrated in volatile high frequency data that might well prove to be transitory and with business and consumer confidence unlikely to deteriorate further in the absence of a major shock to the economy members continued to place favorable odds on an underlying outlook of strengthening expansion factors cited for this positive outlook included the stimulative stances of fiscal and monetary policy the apparent completion in most industries of efforts to bring inventories and capital facilities into desired alignment with expected sales and the support to consumer incomes and business incentives provided by the continued rise in structural productivity further gains in productivity and the prospect for relatively contained demand pressures on resources which were likely to be somewhat more limited for a time than members had anticipated earlier would contribute to keeping price inflation subdued a

modestly increased its forecast for economic growth in 2010 and 2011 better than expected data on employment consumer spending home sales and industrial production received during the intermeeting period pointed to a somewhat stronger increase in real gdp in the current quarter than had previously been projected in addition the positive signal from the incoming data along with the sizable upward revisions to household income in earlier quarters and more supportive financial market conditions led to small upward adjustments to projected growth in real gdp over the rest of the forecast period the staff again anticipated that the recovery would strengthen in 2010 and 2011 supported by further improvement in financial conditions and household balance sheets continued recovery in the housing sector growing household and business confidence and accommodative monetary policy even as the impetus to real activity from fiscal policy diminished however the projected pace of real output

36,2014-04-30,statement,evidence that inflation will move back toward its objective over the medium term the FOMC currently judges that there is sufficient underlying strength in the broader economy to support ongoing improvement in labor market conditions in light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions since the inception of the current asset purchase program the FOMC decided to make a further measured reduction in the pace of its asset purchases beginning in may the FOMC will add to its holdings of agency mortgage backed securities at a pace of 20 billion per month rather than 25 billion per month and will add to its holdings of longer term treasury securities at a pace of 25 billion per month rather than 30 billion per month the FOMC is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities in agency mortgage backed securities and of rolling over maturing treasury securities at auction the FOMC s sizable and still increasing holdings of longer term securities should maintain downward pressure on longer term interest rates support mortgage markets and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation over time is at the rate most consistent with the FOMC s dual mandate the FOMC will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months and will continue its purchases of treasury and agency mortgage backed securities and employ its other policy tools as appropriate until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability if incoming information broadly supports the FOMC s expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer run objective the FOMC will likely reduce the pace of asset purchases in further measured steps at future meetings however asset purchases are not on a preset course and the FOMC s decisions about their pace will remain contingent on the FOMC s outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases to support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability the FOMC today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy remains appropriate in determining how long to,policy restraining economic growth although

in the third quarter commercial bank credit was about flat on average during october and november banks continued to increase their holdings of securities while core loans the sum of commercial and industrial c i real estate and consumer loans decreased moderately the declines were attributable to a drop in consumer loans as well as to continued runoffs in commercial real estate and home equity loans in contrast c i loans edged up ending a nearly two year string of monthly declines in addition the survey of terms of business lending conducted in the first week of november showed that interest rates on c i loans were generally little changed while spreads remained extremely wide according to the latest call report data bank profitability was little changed in the third quarter

fiscal policy was well positioned to help the economy withstand substantial adverse shocks at the same time the staff viewed the risks around its outlook for the unemployment rate as roughly balanced participants views on current conditions and the economic outlook in their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook meeting participants viewed the information received over the intermeeting period as suggesting that economic activity had been expanding moderately in recent months the pace of job gains had been solid and the unemployment rate had declined with a range of labor market indicators suggesting that underutilization of labor resources had continued to diminish participants generally viewed the incoming data as confirming their earlier assessment that the weak report on real gdp in the first quarter reflected transitory factors and expected that real economic activity would continue to expand at a moderate pace over the balance of the year leading to further improvement in labor market conditions however a few participants observed that although gdp growth appeared to have picked up in recent months relative to the first quarter pace the level of gdp remained lower than had been projected earlier in the year inflation continued to run below the FOMC s 2 percent longer run objective partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and further decreases in prices of non energy imports market based measures of inflation compensation remained low while survey based measures of longer term inflation expectations remained stable participants generally anticipated that inflation would rise gradually toward 2 percent as the labor market improved further and the transitory effects of earlier declines in energy and import prices dissipated although many continued to see some downside risks arising from economic and financial developments abroad participants generally viewed the risks to the outlook for domestic economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced with respect to consumer spending the incoming data had been uneven but participants cited reports from contacts suggesting a pickup since the first

part because of earlier declines in energy prices but to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipated and the labor market strengthened further participants generally agreed that the FOMC should continue to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments growth of consumer spending appeared to have picked up from its slow pace in the first quarter retail sales posted strong gains in april and may and sales of light motor vehicles moved back up at the time of the april meeting most participants had anticipated a rebound in consumer spending in light of the still solid fundamental determinants of household spending some participants indicated that consumption was likely to continue being supported by these factors which included ongoing gains in income robust household balance sheets and the positive assessment of current economic conditions that was evident in recent surveys of consumers however a few participants expressed caution about the outlook for consumer expenditures noting that slower increases in employment and higher energy prices could restrain spending the housing sector continued to improve since the beginning of the year reports from a number of participants indicated that single family construction was strengthening and house prices were

bit below the rate of growth of the economy s potential the outlook for modest growth of real gdp reflected a slowdown in the housing market the effects of past policy tightening and a diminished boost to consumer spending from increases in household wealth core consumer price inflation was projected to have stepped up in the second quarter from its average pace over the preceding several

increases in its opportunity cost resulting from rising short term interest rates rates paid on its liquid components particularly lagged increases in market rates partly in response to the receipt of weaker than expected data for spending and output in the first quarter the staff marked down somewhat its forecast of economic growth for 2005 and 2006 even so the economy was seen as retaining considerable momentum and growth was expected to pick up some after the first quarter paced by business spending on equipment and software consumption expenditures were seen as likely to expand at a moderate rate and residential investment to slow with exports forecast to expand a bit more rapidly than imports the arithmetic net drag on the economy from trade was expected to lessen fiscal policy was expected to provide a more moderate impetus to growth this year and next following the substantial boost estimated for earlier years although economic growth was projected to run a bit above the staff s estimate of the economy s potential the unemployment rate was projected to hold around its current level with improvements in job prospects expected to lure more workers back into the labor force inflation was projected to edge lower over the rest of the year and into 2006 reflecting the attenuation of the impact of higher energy prices and the effects of a slowed rate of growth of import prices and remaining slack in resource markets in their discussion of current conditions and the economic outlook meeting participants observed that incoming data over the intermeeting period hinted at possible upside risks for inflation and downside risks for economic growth earlier increases in energy prices seemed to be an important factor contributing to an uptick in core inflation and

this year but inflows to retail money funds slowed as the economic outlook improved and the equity markets rallied m3 expansion remained at a very high rate in november bolstered by the growth of m2 and heavy bank acquisitions of nondeposit liabilities the debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors grew at a moderate pace on balance through october the staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that economic activity would extend its decline for a time in 2002 but then would begin to turn upward the recovery would be supported in part by the cumulative easing that had occurred in the stance of monetary policy along with the fiscal stimulus already in place and some assumed additional measures not yet enacted the turnaround in the economy and the gradual strengthening of the recovery would also be fostered by the completion of downward adjustments to inventories a marked slowing in the contraction of business capital investments and the added purchasing power arising from the recent declines in oil prices economic expansion was projected to strengthen appreciably by the second half of 2002 as the climate for business fixed investment improved and a strengthening of foreign economies led to somewhat greater demand for u s exports subpar expansion in the next few quarters was expected to foster an appreciable further easing of pressures on resources and some moderation in core price inflation in the FOMC s discussion of current and prospective economic developments members commented that the economy clearly was continuing to contract led by further inventory liquidation and ongoing reductions in capital spending the decline in inventories was likely to abate before long boosting production but the course of a recovery would depend on the behavior of final demand the recent statistical and anecdotal information was more mixed than had been the case earlier and pointed on balance toward some moderation in the decline of overall final demand for the first time in a long while the incoming data did not call for a downward revision to current forecasts the members agreed however that the evidence of emerging stabilization in the

factors restraining aggregate demand nonetheless the FOMC judged that some inflation risks remained the extent and timing of any additional firming that might be needed to address these risks would depend on the evolution of the outlook for both inflation and economic growth as implied by incoming information investors had largely anticipated the fomc s decision at its october meeting to leave the target federal funds rate unchanged and to make only modest changes in the accompanying policy statement as a result the announcement of the decision elicited little market reaction as did the subsequent publication of the minutes of the meeting however somewhat weaker than anticipated economic data over the intermeeting period apparently led to some softening of investors perception of the economic outlook as a result the likely pace and extent of policy easing expected by investors increased and yields on nominal and inflation indexed treasury coupon securities fell inflation compensation measures were little changed spreads of investment grade corporate bond yields over those of comparable maturity treasury securities remained about unchanged while those on speculative grade corporate bonds rose a bit broad equity indexes showed solid gains the foreign exchange value of the dollar against other major currencies fell on net over the intermeeting period with pronounced declines against the euro and sterling debt of the domestic nonfinancial sectors in the third quarter expanded at around its second quarter pace business debt rose slightly more slowly than in the second quarter in part reflecting reduced borrowing in the bond and commercial paper markets in the household sector mortgage debt increased at its lowest pace since the late 1990s reflecting the continued deceleration in house prices m2 rose more strongly in october and november than it had in preceding months the staff forecast prepared for this meeting indicated that growth in economic activity had slowed to a pace below that of the economy s long run potential in the second half of 2006 partly as a result of the ongoing adjustment of the housing sector the rate of increase in real gdp was expected to pick up gradually as the drag from the contraction in residential construction diminished returning towards the end of 2007 to a rate close to the staff s estimate,ending october

59,1998-06-30,minutes,evidence suggested that retail sales had moderated in recent weeks in at least some areas the moderation appeared to be only partly associated with the work stoppage at general motors the apparent deceleration in retail sales could prove to be temporary though some slowing in the growth of overall consumer spending over the forecast horizon perhaps to a pace more in line with the growth of disposable income was viewed as a reasonable expectation especially with equity price gains of recent years unlikely to be repeated business fixed investment remained on a strong uptrend buoyed by several favorable factors the latter included the ready availability of debt and equity financing on relatively attractive terms and opportunities to invest in high tech equipment at lower prices to enhance productivity and hold down labor costs in a period of very tight labor markets while these factors were expected to continue to support appreciable further expansion in business investment growth in demand for capital goods was likely to diminish as a result of the projected slowing in the expansion of final sales and business profits and the absence of pressure on manufacturing capacity with regard to the outlook for nonresidential construction members reported that declining vacancy rates and rising prices and rents of office buildings and to some extent other commercial structures were fostering very high levels of construction activity in several areas moreover there were indications that some construction projects were being delayed because of scarcities of labor or construction materials a number of members commented that some of the construction was being undertaken on a speculative basis and that the strong pace of building activity pointed to overbuilding in some areas on the residential side construction activity also displayed considerable strength across much of the country there were widespread anecdotal and other reports of high levels of home sales and few reports of faltering housing demand favorable factors undergirding current housing activity including the robust growth in employment and incomes high wealth to income ratios and very attractive terms on home mortgages seemed likely to continue to hold housing construction close to current elevated levels based on very partial data business inventory investment

61,2004-09-21,minutes,widely anticipated in financial markets the accompanying statement was read as setting a more optimistic tone about economic prospects than had been anticipated and prompted investors to mark up their expectations for the near term path of policy that sentiment was apparently reinforced over the remainder of the period by the comments of several federal reserve officials and the release of the august employment report which seemed to convey the view that the economy was emerging from its soft patch as a result policy rate expectations for the next two quarters ended the intermeeting period slightly firmer longer term policy expectations however moved noticeably lower reflecting the release of relatively benign readings on inflation and the chairman s comments on the inflation outlook in testimony to the house budget committee in line with these revised expectations for the path of policy the term structure of interest rates flattened over the intermeeting period as the two year treasury yield ended about unchanged and the ten year treasury yield dropped somewhat while credit spreads on investment grade corporate bonds narrowed a bit spreads on speculative grade issues fell significantly more particularly in riskier segments of the market probably reflecting greater confidence about prospects in the business sector further evidence of such confidence was visible in equity markets where broad indexes advanced 5½ to 7½ percent the exchange value of the dollar against other major currencies was about unchanged over the intermeeting period m2 balances were about flat on average over the previous two months after contracting a bit in july m2 expanded slightly in august money growth was damped by a rise in the opportunity cost of holding m2 assets as typically occurs in periods of policy tightening in addition the lift to m2 from mortgage refinancings in evidence during the spring was likely still unwinding over the past couple of months depressing the growth of liquid deposits business loans at banks expanded in august for the third consecutive month the staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the economy would continue expanding at a solid pace through the end of 2006 labor market improvements and accommodative monetary policy were seen as counterbalancing the drag from the swing in fiscal policy from

remain robust and further solid economic growth abroad was expected to boost the expansion of u s exports for some period ahead core consumer price inflation was projected to rise somewhat over the forecast horizon in part as a result of higher import prices but largely as a consequence of some further increases in nominal labor compensation gains that would not be fully offset by growth in productivity in the FOMC s discussion of current and prospective economic conditions the members agreed that the information available since midyear provided increased evidence that the growth of aggregate demand and that of aggregate supply were coming into closer balance the statistical evidence reviewed by the FOMC which was supported by widespread anecdotal reports pointed to a noticeable slowing in the expansion of demand and economic activity the slowdown was led by a moderation in consumer spending and some decline in housing expenditures that were occurring even before the full effects of earlier tightening in financial conditions had been felt at the same time an apparent continued acceleration in underlying productivity was boosting the economy s potential output growth and in the context of the leveling out of the broadest measures of equity prices this year was doing so without the full feedback on demand of previous such accelerations while prices were rising somewhat more than a year ago most of this pickup seemed to reflect the direct and indirect effects of higher energy prices and the increase in productivity growth had kept unit labor costs well

expectations moved appreciably lower on net by mid february financial market volatility increased sharply in the second half of the intermeeting period amid an apparent pullback from risk taking that was reportedly spurred by mixed news on domestic economic activity mounting concerns about the subprime mortgage sector and significant declines in foreign equity prices on net over the intermeeting

indicated that in addition to the rise in consumer spending activity in the manufacturing energy and agriculture sectors continued to advance in recent months nonetheless businesses generally reported that they remained cautious regarding capital spending and hiring because of a high level of uncertainty about the economic outlook and the political environment in particular some contacts raised

72,1995-08-22,minutes,to slow from the very rapid pace of the past few years although the lower cost of capital and the ready availability of financing would help to sustain appreciable expansion in such investment export growth would pick up in response to some expected strengthening in the economies of major trading partners considerable uncertainty surrounded the fiscal outlook but the staff continued to anticipate the greater degree of fiscal restraint that had been projected at the time of the last committee meeting in the staff s judgment the prospects for some further easing of pressure on labor and other resources suggested that price inflation likely would not deviate significantly from recent trends in the FOMC s discussion of current and prospective economic developments the members focused on recent indications of some strengthening in the expansion of economic activity after a period of limited growth during the spring further growth in final demand was generating an improvement in overall business activity despite a more rapid adjustment in inventory investment than many had expected this configuration suggested that the risks of recession or an extended period of subpar growth were now reduced and sustained expansion at a moderate pace was seen as the most likely course for the economy although the risks to the economy now seemed to be more evenly balanced than at the time of the july meeting they were still sizable in both directions in particular uncertainties about federal budget policies and their effects on the economy remained substantial with respect to prices members noted that the recent pause in the expansion had eased pressures on resources and the economy appeared to be in a better position to accommodate moderate growth over the forecast horizon without adding to inflation indeed some members were optimistic that growth of the economy at a pace in line with their expectations would be consistent with modest further decreases in inflation others expressed concern however that the uncertainties surrounding the outlook for the economy included questions about the persistence of inflationary sentiment and the prospects for further progress toward stable prices over the next several quarters members gave particular attention to the ongoing discussions involving the congress and the administration regarding future federal

74,2004-05-04,minutes,and economies in the euro area m2 grew briskly during march and april as continued low opportunity costs and the temporary effects of mortgage refinancing boosted liquid deposits the strength was likely offset somewhat by the effects of individual non withheld tax payments in april which were lower than last year and therefore probably led to a smaller buildup in liquid deposits than incorporated in the seasonal adjustment factors although currency growth continued to be held down in the first quarter by weak demand from abroad it moved closer to its long term trend in april the staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the economy would continue to expand briskly for the rest of 2004 before decelerating somewhat in 2005 as fiscal policy shifted to a slightly restrictive stance the considerable monetary and fiscal stimulus this year and still strong advances in structural productivity were expected to cause businesses to shed still more of the caution they had been exhibiting in investing and hiring the labor market was projected to show steady improvement through the end of 2004 but the forecasted pace of hiring was expected to slow a little next year as economic growth moderated the staff anticipated that inventories would increase at a modest rate during the forecast horizon as businesses responded to continued strength in demand business spending on equipment and software was expected to remain strong with the expiration of the partial expensing tax provision at the end of 2004 adding impetus this year the rise in mortgage rates was not likely to show through to demand for housing until the second half of 2004 and was expected to be partially offset in the longer term by rising employment and personal income the increases in employment and income were also projected to continue to boost consumer spending in light of recent increases in some price measures the staff anticipated a transitory rise in the pace of core inflation in the near term however it was expected that the remaining slack in resource utilization and strong productivity growth would keep core inflation at a low level over the forecast period in the FOMC s discussion of current and prospective economic developments a number of members noted that the outlook for production and employment had improved distinctly in the period since

75,1995-02-01,minutes,relatively low inventory sales ratios across much of the economy and little anecdotal or other evidence of unintended inventory accumulation moreover because an unusually large share of the inventory buildup in recent quarters appeared to involve imports a cutback in such investment should tend to have a smaller than usual impact on domestic production there was no current evidence that inventory investment was slowing and indeed recent data on business loans at banks might suggest some acceleration in inventory accumulation since the beginning of the year nonetheless as more moderate growth in final demand began to emerge concerns about the availability of materials used in the production process or stocks needed to meet market demand should diminish and business firms could be expected to trim their demand for inventories perhaps aggressively for a time indeed this sector of the economy might well account for much of the slowing in the expansion for some period of time during the year ahead fiscal policy was under active debate in the congress and the members viewed the outcome of that debate as very uncertain the emergence of a moderately restrictive fiscal policy might be a reasonable assumption to incorporate in current forecasts albeit an assumption that clearly was subject to a wide range of error in any event any progress toward cutting future budget deficits was likely to have a favorable effect on domestic financial markets and perhaps also on the dollar in foreign exchange markets developments in mexico and their possible repercussions in other developing nations had negative implications for u s exports at least over the short run indeed some members cited anecdotal evidence that reduced trade with mexico had already emerged since late 1994 moreover the effects of the earthquake in kobe japan seemed to be disrupting trade with that nation in agricultural and other bulk goods and was likely to continue doing so over the near term looking beyond the months immediately ahead the relatively robust growth projected for many industrial countries together with the lower value of the dollar should boost the nation

78,2004-03-16,minutes,that economic activity would continue to expand at a solid pace through 2005 monetary policy is expected to support growth over the projection period and fiscal policy is anticipated to remain accommodative through 2004 in addition structural productivity growth is projected to remain substantial this year and next strong advances in real disposable income were expected to keep consumer spending on a solid upward trajectory business spending on equipment and software was seen as increasing briskly as a result of sizable profits an improving outlook for demand and continued favorable financing conditions also inventory investment was anticipated to rise gradually as businesses became more convinced that final demand was expanding along a sustainable track the pace of economic expansion was forecasted to be sufficient to reduce resource slack over this year and next although the employment data received over the intermeeting period indicated that this process would begin from a higher rate of unused resources than had been previously expected core inflation was projected to remain low over the forecast period in the FOMC s discussion of current and prospective economic developments the members noted that overall economic activity still seemed to be increasing at a solid pace though perhaps not quite as quickly as some members had anticipated at the time of the january meeting investment spending had continued to advance and the manufacturing sector which had lagged the rest of the economy earlier in the expansion had extended recent gains residential construction activity was down somewhat from the very high levels posted late last year but increases in household wealth and the effects of last year s tax cuts continued to buoy consumer spending despite the gains in spending and production however employment growth had been disappointing while job losses had moderated hiring had yet to strengthen holding down net increases in employment nonetheless the breadth of the expansion was seen as providing considerable assurance of its sustainability and committee members generally expected that accommodative monetary policy favorable financial market conditions and at least in the near term fiscal stimulus would continue to foster a pace of output growth that exceeded that of its potential although economic slack

nonsupervisory workers rose sharply in january but for the twelve months ended in january the increase was the same as that recorded for the previous twelve months at its meeting on december 21 1993 the FOMC adopted a directive that called for maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions and that did not include a presumption about the likely direction of any adjustment to policy during the intermeeting period accordingly the directive indicated that in the context of the FOMC s long run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth and giving careful consideration to economic financial and monetary developments slightly greater or slightly lesser reserve restraint might be acceptable during the intermeeting period the reserve conditions associated with this directive were expected to be consistent with modest growth of m2 and m3 over the following months open market operations were directed toward maintaining the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions throughout the intermeeting period additional reserves were supplied to the banking system on a temporary basis around year end to meet seasonal movements in currency and required reserves as well as an enlarged demand for excess reserves for the intermeeting period as a whole the federal funds rate remained close to 3 percent while adjustment plus seasonal borrowing averaged somewhat more than anticipated most market interest rates declined slightly during the intermeeting period and major indexes of stock prices posted new highs market participants saw the incoming news

81,2003-12-09,minutes,the ability of the united states to continue to finance its current account deficit and risks stemming from developments in afghanistan iraq and turkey m2 contracted significantly in november for the third consecutive month a sizable part of the declines in these three months appeared to be due to the falloff in mortgage refinancing activity and the resulting reductions in associated deposit balances in addition rising equity markets may have made m2 accounts relatively less attractive the staff forecast prepared for this meeting indicated that the economic expansion was likely to be sufficiently robust to reduce economic slack substantially in coming quarters accommodative financial conditions fiscal stimulus and substantial gains in structural productivity would continue to provide significant impetus to business and consumer spending over the months ahead in addition businesses appeared to be shedding some of the caution that had characterized their behavior for the previous three years as a consequence with sales profits and stock prices higher the liquidation of inventories appeared to be ending and the strengthening of capital investment and pickup in hiring already evident in the data were projected to continue even though the unemployment rate was projected to decline over coming quarters some slight downward pressure on core consumer price inflation was anticipated in the forecast given ongoing slack in resource utilization in the FOMC s discussion of current and prospective economic developments members referred to widespread indications that the pickup in the economic expansion was broadening and becoming more entrenched the members noted that spending by households had remained strong even as the effects of tax cuts and mortgage refinancing began to wane and with business confidence on the mend investment outlays had increased rapidly and employment had revived while assessments by individual members of the likely pace of the expansion going forward differed somewhat they generally expected growth to run at a rate that would trim slack in labor and goods markets over the forecast period assuming no major shocks to the economy factors supporting this view included stimulative monetary and fiscal policies accommodative conditions in financial markets building business confidence a rebound in profits and the effects on the external sector of the weaker dollar and pickup in growth abroad while downside risks to the outlook had diminished some members remained concerned that

stance of policy some members expressed concern however that accelerated release of the minutes might have the potential to feed back adversely on the deliberations of the FOMC and on the minutes themselves the members also emphasized the importance of allowing sufficient time for them to review and comment on the minutes and for reconciling differences of opinion among the members of a large and geographically dispersed committee at the conclusion of this discussion staff was asked to study the issue further the members also discussed the possible advantages of making some changes in the content time horizon and frequency of the individual forecasts that are summarized in the semi annual monetary policy reports to the congress in general the members saw little to be gained by altering the FOMC s current practices in any significant way although some proposed relatively minor changes it was agreed that there was no need to reach a decision on such changes at this time but staff was instructed to ascertain the degree of interest on the part of the members in making possible minor adjustments to current procedures the FOMC then turned to a discussion of the economic outlook and the conduct of monetary policy over the intermeeting period the economy appeared to have expanded at a robust pace in the fourth quarter though well below the exceptional pace recorded in the third quarter consumer spending continued to increase at a solid rate over the final three months of the year and activity in the residential sector remained at a very high level on the business side outlays for equipment and software likely posted moderate gains in the fourth quarter and firms apparently accumulated inventories for the first time in three quarters despite the strong pace of economic activity the labor market was improving only slowly with private payrolls showing a small acceleration in the fourth quarter core consumer price inflation continued to slow and inflation

neither the subsequent release of the minutes of the meeting nor the march 7 federal reserve announcements elicited significant market reaction the march 11 tslf announcement was followed by a step up in money market futures rates as liquidity concerns eased somewhat and market participants evidently concluded that less policy easing would be needed than previously anticipated however liquidity concerns reemerged subsequently prompting a further drop in money market futures rates consistent with the shift in the economic outlook the revision in policy expectations and the reduction in the target federal funds rate yields on short and medium term nominal treasury coupon securities declined substantially after the january 30 fomc meeting however yields on long term treasuries fell much less than those on shorter term instruments and the yield curve steepened significantly inflation compensation the difference between yields on nominal treasury securities and those on inflation

87,2014-01-29,statement,the inception of its current asset purchase program the FOMC continues to see the improvement in economic activity and labor market conditions over that period as consistent with growing underlying strength in the broader economy in light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions the FOMC decided to make a further measured reduction in the pace of its asset purchases beginning in february the FOMC will add to its holdings of agency mortgage backed securities at a pace of 30 billion per month rather than 35 billion per month and will add to its holdings of longer term treasury securities at a pace of 35 billion per month rather than 40 billion per month the FOMC is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities in agency mortgage backed securities and of rolling over maturing treasury securities at auction the FOMC s sizable and still increasing holdings of longer term securities should maintain downward pressure on longer term interest rates support mortgage markets and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation over time is at the rate most consistent with the FOMC s dual mandate the FOMC will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months and will continue its purchases of treasury and agency mortgage backed securities and employ its other policy tools as appropriate until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability if incoming information broadly supports the FOMC s expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer run objective the FOMC will likely reduce the pace of asset purchases in further measured steps at future meetings however asset purchases are not on a preset course and the FOMC s decisions about their pace will remain contingent on the FOMC s outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases to support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability the FOMC today reaffirmed its view that a highly

treasury securities rose almost as much as those on their nominal counterparts leaving inflation compensation only slightly higher on net by the end of the intermeeting period yields on investment and speculative grade corporate securities rose about the same amount as those on comparable treasuries leaving risk spreads about unchanged generally positive economic news and further improvements in the outlook for corporate earnings evidently offset the influence of higher interest rates and major equity indexes edged higher over the intermeeting period in foreign exchange markets the dollar depreciated somewhat against major currencies and it rose a bit against an index of currencies of other major u s trading partners m2 continued to expand rapidly in may the upswing in m2 growth since late winter stemmed in part from the temporary effects of mortgage refinancing which boosted liquid deposits over this period though m2 was also buoyed by strong gains in nominal income in recent months a rebound in currency growth and reduced portfolio shifts by households from monetary assets to equities and bonds also supported the expansion of m2 the growth of m2 slowed appreciably during the first half of june commercial bank credit decelerated in may reflecting a contraction in bank holdings of securities and a slowdown in the growth of loans the slowing in loan growth was concentrated mainly in real estate credits and was due partly to heavy securitizations the staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the economy would continue to expand at a solid pace through 2005 monetary policy was expected to support economic activity over the projection period and fiscal policy was anticipated to remain accommodative through 2004 moreover persisting strong

improvement in investor sentiment toward risky assets foreign equity prices generally rose over the intermeeting period and foreign sovereign and corporate bond spreads narrowed in addition both bond and equity emerging market mutual funds saw net inflows over the period staff economic outlook in the economic forecast prepared by the staff for the june fomc meeting real gdp growth in the first half of this year as a whole was lower on net than in the projection for the april meeting in particular the available readings on exports inventory investment outlays for health care services and construction pointed to much weaker real gdp in the first quarter than the staff had expected however the staff still anticipated that real gdp growth would rebound briskly in the second quarter consistent with recent indicators for consumer spending and business investment along with the expectation that exports and inventory investment would return to more normal levels and that economic activity that had been restrained by the severe winter weather would bounce back primarily because of the combination of recent downward surprises in the unemployment rate and weaker than expected real gdp the staff slightly lowered its assumed pace of potential output growth this year and next and slightly decreased its assumption for the natural rate of unemployment over this same period as a result the staff s medium term forecast for real gdp growth was revised down a little on balance nevertheless the staff continued to project that real gdp would expand at a faster pace in the second half of this year and over the next two years than it did last year and that it would rise more quickly than potential output the faster pace of real gdp growth was expected to be supported by diminishing drag on spending from changes in fiscal policy increases in consumer and business confidence further improvements in credit availability and a pickup in the rate of foreign economic growth the expansion in economic activity was anticipated to slowly reduce resource slack over the projection period and the unemployment rate was expected to decline gradually to the staff s estimate of its

94,2014-06-18,statement,its objective over the medium term the FOMC currently judges that there is sufficient underlying strength in the broader economy to support ongoing improvement in labor market conditions in light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions since the inception of the current asset purchase program the FOMC decided to make a further measured reduction in the pace of its asset purchases beginning in july the FOMC will add to its holdings of agency mortgage backed securities at a pace of 15 billion per month rather than 20 billion per month and will add to its holdings of longer term treasury securities at a pace of 20 billion per month rather than 25 billion per month the FOMC is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities in agency mortgage backed securities and of rolling over maturing treasury securities at auction the FOMC s sizable and still increasing holdings of longer term securities should maintain downward pressure on longer term interest rates support mortgage markets and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation over time is at the rate most consistent with the FOMC s dual mandate the FOMC will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months and will continue its purchases of treasury and agency mortgage backed securities and employ its other policy tools as appropriate until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability if incoming information broadly supports the FOMC s expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer run objective the FOMC will likely reduce the pace of asset purchases in further measured steps at future meetings however asset purchases are not on a preset course and the FOMC s decisions about their pace will remain contingent on the FOMC s outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases to support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability the FOMC today reaffirmed its view

95,1997-07-01,minutes,activity in particular jobs and incomes had continued to post sizable gains further large increases in stock market prices had raised wealth to income ratios sharply and consumer optimism had risen to new highs on the other hand the accumulation of consumer durables that had occurred over the course of the current cyclical advance was likely to exert a retarding influence on the rise in consumer spending other somewhat restraining factors included the prospect of some softening in housing demand and related purchases of household goods and the already heavy debt repayment burdens of many consumers some members also noted that a possible correction from the currently elevated levels of stock market prices could have adverse effects on consumer sentiment and purchasing power on balance growth in personal consumer expenditures was seen as likely to approximate the moderate rate of increase projected in overall domestic demand the members viewed the prospects for further growth in business fixed investment as another important supportive factor in the outlook for sustained economic expansion current indicators pointed to the continuation of very rapid growth in such spending over the near term but some moderation was likely over the course of coming quarters in conjunction with the projected slowing in the increase of overall demand and the very large buildup in the stock of capital that already had occurred in recent years even so investment spending was likely to be relatively robust over the projection horizon in the context of continuing incentives to hold down production costs in highly competitive markets and to take advantage of falling prices and wider applications for certain types of new equipment notably computer related equipment the ready availability of both debt and equity finance on favorable terms an upbeat outlook for sales in many industries and generally high profit levels were other positive factors the outlook for nonresidential construction activity also seemed to be relatively favorable members referred to declining vacancy rates and rising rents for commercial structures in many parts of the country and noted that construction contracts for new office buildings and hotels recently had turned up on a nationwide basis after a pause earlier this year in sum the growth in business fixed

in the near term faced with persisting weakness in product and labor markets businesses and consumers were likely to hold down their spending in addition continued slow economic growth in most of the nation s major trading partners would tend to restrain u s exports though those restraints were expected to abate over time the cumulative effects of an accommodative monetary policy likely further reduction in taxes and robust gains in structural productivity would provide significant impetus to spending inventory overhangs had been substantially reduced and business capital stocks had moved

levels seen earlier last year while production outside of the motor vehicle sector was roughly flat production in the mining sector continued to fall and the output of utilities declined as the

difficult to relate with confidence projections of demand and activity to prospects for inflation members observed that they saw no indications that the impressive gains in productivity might be moderating and indeed the most recent data suggested some further acceleration moreover persistent disparities between the household and establishment series on employment growth might be reconciled by higher immigration than previously estimated further boosting potential growth nonetheless the increase in aggregate demand had been exceeding even the now higher sustainable rate of growth in aggregate supply as indicated by declines in the pool of available but unemployed workers to a very low level and by the rise in imports this difference between the growth of demand and potential supply could well persist unless demand moderated absent a possible moderation an upturn in unit labor costs was seen as a likely possibility with eventual adverse implications for price inflation inflation pressures might also be augmented over time by a number of special factors such as the rise in energy prices the effects on import prices of the dollar s depreciation and strengthening foreign economies and faster increases in medical costs while several of these factors implied limited price level adjustments they could become embedded to a degree in ongoing inflation through their effects on wage increases and inflation expectations over the nearer term however subdued inflation expectations were likely to damp any incipient uptrend in the rate of price inflation in their

down sharply in response to the outlook for a weaker economic recovery and the adverse implications for corporate profits of economic and other developments in foreign exchange markets the trade weighted value of the dollar in terms of the major foreign currencies eased somewhat over the intermeeting period much of the dollar s decline occurred late in the period in response to the mixed character of u s economic data and relatively small declines in benchmark longer term yields abroad the dollar rose slightly on average in terms of an index of the currencies of other important trading partners in part because of the further depreciation of the argentine peso m2 and m3 contracted in march and april the declines evidently reflected in part the rising opportunity costs of holding m2 assets as yields on the components of m2 declined in lagged response to the earlier easing of monetary policy and fostered transfers out of m2 funds especially from retail money market funds to stock and bond mutual funds reduced demand for mortgage refinancing and lower nonwithheld federal payments also contributed importantly to the weakness in the broad monetary aggregates the staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the expansion in economic activity was slowing substantially in the current quarter but would pick up in the second half of the year and continue at a moderate pace next year an emerging shift by businesses from inventory liquidation to some replenishment of stocks would help boost activity over the next several quarters but the ongoing recovery would depend increasingly on growth in spending by households and businesses such spending would be fostered by the monetary ease and fiscal stimulus already in place and abetted by vigorous anticipated growth in structural productivity which would support household incomes and business investment incentives with a relatively robust contour for the course of final sales over the forecast horizon the pressure on resources would rise somewhat despite the anticipated higher growth of structural productivity nonetheless activity would remain below the economy s potential for a

104,2000-06-28,minutes,from its currently elevated pace to a rate around or perhaps a little below the growth of the economy s estimated potential the expansion of domestic final demand increasingly would be held back by the anticipated waning of positive wealth effects associated with earlier large gains in equity prices and by higher interest rates as a result growth of spending on consumer durables and houses was expected to slow further by contrast business fixed investment notably purchases of equipment and software was projected to remain robust and continued solid economic growth abroad would boost the growth of u s exports for some period ahead core price inflation was projected to rise noticeably over the forecast horizon partly as a result of higher import prices and some firming of gains in nominal labor compensation in persistently tight labor markets that would not be fully offset by productivity growth in the FOMC s discussion of current and prospective economic developments members cited evidence of slower expansion in economic activity in recent months in particular consumer spending had decelerated noticeably especially for housing and motor vehicles but the members agreed that the eventual extent and duration of the slowing in overall economic growth were subject to substantial uncertainty a number of factors supported a projection of considerably more moderate expansion going forward in relation to the overly rapid pace in the second half of 1999 and early 2000 including the likelihood that much of the effect on spending of the rise in interest rates and leveling out in equity prices this year had not yet been felt nevertheless the indications of slowing economic expansion were still tentative some sectors of the economy such as business fixed investment continued to display substantial vigor and the members could not be confident that growth would not rebound to a clearly unsustainable pace as had occurred previously in this expansion with regard to inflation members observed that steep increases in energy prices had boosted overall rates of inflation somewhat and in addition the higher energy prices likely had contributed indirectly to the rise in core measures of inflation a number of members also were concerned that rising core inflation could be generated increasingly from unsustainably tight labor markets and they noted that labor costs would need to be monitored closely even if growth in demand slowed sufficiently to keep levels of resource utilization about unchanged to date,background

numerous areas tended to confirm more positive nationwide statistics the rising levels of nonresidential construction activity tended to be concentrated in commercial and industrial facilities and public works projects the construction of office buildings continued to lag but this sector appeared to have stabilized or perhaps improved marginally after a long period of decline more generally currently positive business attitudes augured well for further growth in overall business investment but on the negative side it was noted that further turbulence in financial markets could erode confidence with adverse implications for investment spending residential construction was described as quite strong in numerous areas although overall housing construction had been held down thus far this year by severe winter weather in numerous parts of the country shortages of skilled construction workers and building materials were reported in many areas despite generally rising final demands business firms were continuing to maintain lean inventory positions in their ongoing efforts to hold down costs nonetheless with production levels in many industries approaching or reaching full capacity utilization prices of some materials and other business purchases coming under increasing pressure and delivery lead times tending to lengthen at least in some industries efforts to build inventories could be expected to materialize and in one view the potential for such a development represented a key upside risk from current forecasts in this connection some members referred to scattered indications of efforts to increase inventories notably of steel products manufacturers of motor vehicles also were in the process of rebuilding depleted inventories though the currently stimulative impact of such rebuilding on overall production was likely to be reversed when motor vehicle stocks reached desired levels in the months ahead the foreign trade sector was expected to remain a negative factor in the economic outlook however the members anticipated some improvement in the economies of major foreign industrial nations which together with some moderation in the growth

119,2002-06-26,minutes,despite the expected strong growth of structural productivity though the level of activity would remain below the economy s potential for some time the persistence of underutilized resources was expected to foster some moderation in core price inflation in the FOMC s discussion of current and prospective economic conditions members commented that there had been little change since the may meeting in the factors bearing on what they viewed as a favorable outlook for a pickup in the expansion although financial markets and perhaps business and household confidence had been shaken by revelations of accounting irregularities the economy had continued to expand and the prospects for accelerating aggregate demand remained positive some members observed however that they had expected to see firmer indications of a strengthening recovery by the time of this meeting the degree of impetus from decelerating inventory liquidation and growth in final demand had moderated during the spring and anecdotal and other evidence indicated that the performance of various industries and firms had remained uneven looking ahead the timing and strength of an upturn in the expansion remained subject to considerable uncertainty but in the absence of major further adverse shocks to confidence the members anticipated that economic activity would accelerate over coming months to a pace in the vicinity of and perhaps somewhat above the rate of growth of the economy s potential in support of this view members cited the accommodative stance of both fiscal and monetary policy and the continuation of impressive growth in productivity that should buttress household incomes and spending and encourage a pickup in business investment the strength in productivity also would help to hold down cost and price pressures and given an economic expansion and resource utilization in line with the members forecasts would reinforce the prospect that core price inflation would remain low in preparation for the mid year monetary policy report to congress the members of the board of governors and the presidents of the federal reserve banks submitted

economic projections and policy assessments are described in the summary of economic projections sep which is attached as an addendum to these minutes in their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook meeting participants viewed the information received over the intermeeting period as suggesting that the economy was expanding at a moderate pace they generally indicated that the broad contours of their outlook for real activity the labor market and inflation had not changed materially since their october meeting but most expressed greater confidence in the outlook and saw the risks associated with their forecasts of real gdp growth and the unemployment rate as more nearly balanced than earlier in the year almost all participants continued to project that the rate of growth of economic activity would strengthen in coming years and all anticipated that the unemployment rate would gradually decline toward levels consistent with their current assessments of its longer run normal value the projected improvement in economic activity was expected to be supported by highly accommodative monetary policy diminished fiscal policy restraint and a pickup in global economic growth as well as a further easing of credit conditions and continued improvements in household balance sheets inflation remained below the FOMC s longer run objective over the intermeeting period nevertheless participants still anticipated that with longer run inflation expectations stable and economic activity picking up inflation would move back toward its objective over the medium run but they noted that inflation persistently below the FOMC s objective would pose risks to economic performance and so saw a need to monitor inflation developments carefully consumer spending appeared to be strengthening with solid gains in retail sales in recent months and a rebound in motor vehicle sales in november on balance retail contacts reportedly were fairly optimistic about holiday sales

121,2013-12-18,statement,since the inception of its current asset purchase program the FOMC sees the improvement in economic activity and labor market conditions over that period as consistent with growing underlying strength in the broader economy in light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions the FOMC decided to modestly reduce the pace of its asset purchases beginning in january the FOMC will add to its holdings of agency mortgage backed securities at a pace of 35 billion per month rather than 40 billion per month and will add to its holdings of longer term treasury securities at a pace of 40 billion per month rather than 45 billion per month the FOMC is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities in agency mortgage backed securities and of rolling over maturing treasury securities at auction the FOMC s sizable and still increasing holdings of longer term securities should maintain downward pressure on longer term interest rates support mortgage markets and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation over time is at the rate most consistent with the FOMC s dual mandate the FOMC will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months and will continue its purchases of treasury and agency mortgage backed securities and employ its other policy tools as appropriate until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability if incoming information broadly supports the FOMC s expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer run objective the FOMC will likely reduce the pace of asset purchases in further measured steps at future meetings however asset purchases are not on a preset course and the FOMC s decisions about their pace will remain contingent on the FOMC s outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases to support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability the FOMC today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of

modestly currency growth was apparently bolstered by elevated foreign demand commercial bank credit contracted in march and was estimated to have dropped again in april the decline in bank credit in

economic outlook most participants agreed that economic growth was likely to remain moderate over coming quarters and then pick up gradually however some participants indicated that they had lowered their near term forecasts for economic growth in light of the weaker than expected increases in consumer spending and employment in recent months in addition some participants expressed concern about the persistent headwinds restraining the pace of the recovery including the weak housing sector still tight borrowing conditions for some households and firms and fiscal restraint at all levels of government many participants judged that a high level of uncertainty about possible spillovers from the fiscal and banking strains in the euro area and about the outlook for u s fiscal or regulatory

on net over october and november and nominal construction spending by these governments was about flat in october the nominal u s international trade deficit narrowed in october exports fell a little with declines in all export categories except for services and industrial supplies imports fell much more and the declines were broad based with the largest contributions coming from imports of consumer goods and automotive products available trade data suggested that the contribution of net exports to real gdp growth which was slightly negative in the third quarter would turn somewhat positive in the fourth quarter foreign economic growth slowed further in the third quarter amid continued weakness in the global manufacturing sector recent monthly indicators pointed to a stabilization in the pace of economic growth in china and several advanced foreign economies however other indicators suggested that social unrest weighed heavily on economic activity in several

130,2018-06-13,minutes,slightly softer incoming data on nonmarket prices but the forecast for the second half of the year was a little higher reflecting an upward revision to projected consumer energy prices over the next couple of quarters the staff continued to project that total pce inflation would remain near the FOMC s 2 percent objective over the medium term and that core pce price inflation would run slightly higher than total inflation over that period because of a projected decline in consumer energy prices in 2019 and 2020 the staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real gdp growth the unemployment rate and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years the staff saw the risks to the forecasts for real gdp growth and the unemployment rate as balanced on the upside recent fiscal policy changes could lead to a greater expansion in economic activity over the next few years than the staff projected on the downside those fiscal policy changes could yield less impetus to the economy than the staff expected if for example the marginal propensities to consume for groups most affected by the tax cuts are lower than the staff had assumed risks to the inflation projection also were seen as balanced the upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to move further above its potential was counterbalanced by the downside risk that longer term inflation expectations may be lower than was assumed in the staff forecast participants views on current conditions and the economic outlook in conjunction with this fomc meeting members of the board of governors and federal reserve bank presidents submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real gdp growth the unemployment rate and inflation for each year from 2018 through 2020 and over the longer run based on their individual assessments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate the longer run projections

individual currencies varied widely m2 edged lower over april and may as the opportunity cost of holding m2 assets rose further liquid deposits were especially weak owing to the slow adjustment of yields paid on these deposits to increases in market rates despite the recent softness in m2 its velocity remained quite low relative to its historical relationships with opportunity cost bank credit decelerated sharply in april and may from rapid gains posted in the first quarter as growth in both securities and loans fell in the staff forecast prepared for this meeting the economy was seen as likely to expand this year and next at a rate just above its potential the effects of reduced monetary and fiscal policy stimulus were expected to be counterbalanced by continued low long term interest rates and an abatement of energy related headwinds household spending was expected to firm going forward as real income posts solid gains attributable in part to the ongoing improvement in the labor market business investment was projected to benefit from the combination of favorable prospects for sales supportive financial markets and the ongoing need to replace or upgrade aging equipment and software a slightly larger portion of domestic demand was expected to be supplied by imports over the forecast period the forecast for consumer price inflation was revised up with inflation seen as somewhat higher this year than in 2004 reflecting in part higher import prices and the direct and indirect effects of higher energy prices and only edging lower next year as these price pressures wane in their discussion of current conditions and the economic outlook many meeting participants noted that incoming data had been reassuring about the strength of the expansion

135,2012-04-25,minutes,economic outlook were little changed with the intermeeting information generally seen as suggesting that economic growth would remain moderate over coming quarters and then pick up gradually reflecting the moderate pace of economic growth most anticipated a gradual decline in the unemployment rate the incoming information led some participants to become more confident about the durability of the recovery however others thought it was premature to infer a stronger underlying trend from the recent positive indicators since those readings may partially reflect the effects of the mild winter weather or other temporary influences a number of factors continued to be seen as likely limiting the economic expansion to a moderate pace in the near term these included slow growth in some foreign economies prospective fiscal tightening in the united states slow household income growth and notwithstanding some recent signs of improvement ongoing weakness in the housing market participants continued to expect most of the factors restraining economic expansion to ease over time and so anticipated that the recovery would gradually gain strength the strains in global financial markets though generally less pronounced than last fall continued to pose a significant risk to the outlook and the possibility of a sharp fiscal tightening in the united states was also considered a sizable risk most participants anticipated that inflation would fall back from recent elevated levels as the effects of higher energy prices waned and still expected that inflation subsequently would run at or below the 2 percent rate that the FOMC judges to be most consistent with its statutory mandate however other participants saw upside risks to the inflation outlook given the recent pickup in inflation and the highly accommodative stance of monetary policy in discussing the household sector meeting participants generally noted that consumer spending continued to expand moderately notwithstanding high gasoline prices the recent strengthening in the pace of light motor vehicle sales was attributed to both pent up demand and the desire for increased fuel efficiency in the wake of higher gasoline prices looking forward increases in household wealth from the rise in equity prices improving consumer sentiment and a diminishing drag from household deleveraging were seen as helping to support continued increases in household expenditures notwithstanding sluggish growth in real disposable income and restrictive fiscal policies recent housing sector indicators

income and rising opportunity cost the staff forecast prepared for this meeting indicated that real gdp growth would slow in the second half of 2006 and 2007 and to a lower rate than had been anticipated in the prior forecast the marking down of the outlook was largely attributable to the annual revision of the national income and product accounts which involved downward revisions to actual gdp growth in prior years and prompted reductions in the staff s estimate of potential output the slowdown in the housing market the effects of higher energy prices on household purchasing power the waning impetus of household wealth effects on consumer spending and the effects of past policy tightening were expected to hold economic growth below potential over the next six quarters core consumer price inflation was projected to drop back somewhat later this year and next mainly as the effects of higher energy and import prices abated in their discussion of the economic situation

contributed to such a price performance would persist remained a key uncertainty in the economic outlook and the members generally agreed that the risks continued to be tilted to some extent in the direction of rising price inflation over the forecast horizon return to top in their discussion of the outlook for spending in key sectors of the economy members commented that consumer expenditures were likely to pick up after their summer lull though probably to a pace appreciably below that in the first half of this year favorable factors in the outlook for consumer spending included strong gains in employment and income the wealth effect stemming from the rise that had occurred in the value of financial assets and generally buoyant consumer sentiment the improvement in the consumer sector would tend to be restrained however by the increase in consumer debt burdens and the probable satisfaction of much of the pent up demands for consumer durables during the current expansion business fixed investment likewise was expected to provide considerable further stimulus to the economy expenditures for business equipment notably for office and computing equipment were expected to expand substantially further and recent weakness in nonresidential construction might well prove to be temporary judging in part from anecdotal reports of considerable strength in commercial real estate markets in many areas on the whole however the completion of numerous capital spending programs in conjunction with slower projected growth in overall demand could be expected to temper the expansion of business investment over coming quarters in the housing sector recent developments were somewhat mixed but they suggested on balance that housing activity had held up better than expected in the light of increased mortgage interest rates it was suggested in this regard that the retarding effects of higher rates on fixed rate mortgage contracts were being blunted to some extent by

expansionary in the coming years the unemployment rate was projected to decline gradually over the next couple of years and to continue running below the staff s estimate of its longer run natural rate over this period the staff s forecast for consumer price inflation as measured by the change in the pce price index was revised down slightly for 2017 because of the weaker than expected incoming data for inflation however the projection was little changed thereafter as the recent weakness in inflation was viewed as transitory inflation was still expected to be somewhat higher this year than last year largely reflecting an upturn in the prices for food and non energy imports the staff projected that inflation would increase further in the next couple of years and that it would be close to the FOMC s longer run objective in 2018 and at 2 percent in 2019 the staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real gdp growth the unemployment rate and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years many financial market indicators of uncertainty were subdued and the uncertainty associated with the foreign outlook appeared to have subsided further on balance since late last year these developments were judged as counterweights to elevated measures of economic policy uncertainty the staff saw the risks to the forecasts for real gdp and the unemployment rate as balanced the staff s assessment was that the downside risks associated with monetary policy not being well positioned to respond to adverse shocks had diminished since its previous forecast the risks to the projection for inflation also were seen as roughly balanced the downside risks from the possibility that longer term inflation expectations may have edged down or that the dollar could

persistently below its 2 percent objective could pose risks to economic performance but it anticipates that inflation will move back toward its objective over the medium term taking into account the extent of federal fiscal retrenchment the FOMC sees the improvement in economic activity and labor market conditions since it began its asset purchase program a year ago as consistent with growing underlying strength in the broader economy however the FOMC decided to await more evidence that progress will be sustained before adjusting the pace of its purchases accordingly the FOMC decided to continue purchasing additional agency mortgage backed securities at a pace of 40 billion per month and longer term treasury securities at a pace of 45 billion per month the FOMC is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities in agency mortgage backed securities and of rolling over maturing treasury securities at auction taken together these actions should maintain downward pressure on longer term interest rates support mortgage markets and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation over time is at the rate most consistent with the FOMC s dual mandate the FOMC will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months and will continue its purchases of treasury and agency mortgage backed securities and employ its other policy tools as appropriate until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability in judging when to moderate the pace of asset purchases the FOMC will at its coming

as the upward pressure on consumer prices from earlier increases in import and commodity prices was expected to persist a little longer than previously anticipated but these influences were still

such risks had diminished appreciably since last fall a few participants warned that in light of ongoing fiscal restraint and a weak global outlook economic data could remain soft for the next few months regardless of the underlying strength of the economy consumer spending was reported to be strong in a number of areas of the country and more broadly appeared to be supported by rising equity and house prices improved household balance sheets and easier credit conditions however concerns were expressed that this rate of growth in consumer expenditures might not be sustainable without the support of a notable pickup in business investment and hiring other factors that might affect spending also were mentioned for example the losses in income and wealth experienced during the crisis might lead households to be more cautious in their spending and to save at a higher rate wealth gains in recent years appeared concentrated among higher net worth individuals who may have a lower propensity to spend out of additional wealth and retailers reported weakness in spending by lower income households who had been more affected by the increase in payroll taxes participants saw the housing market as having strengthened further during the intermeeting period and pointed variously to rising house prices growth in home sales a lower inventory of houses for sale a reduction in the average time houses stayed on the market and encouraging reports from homebuilders more all cash or investor purchases were being reported and the pace of home purchases overall appeared to be constrained less by a lack of demand than by a lack of homes for sale in part reflecting fewer newly foreclosed houses coming onto the market the rate of new delinquencies on mortgages declined nearly

worth and buoyant consumer sentiment business contacts in a few districts reported strong pre holiday sales many participants expected the proposed cuts in personal taxes to provide some boost to consumer spending a few participants noted that expectations of tax reform may have already raised consumer spending somewhat to the extent that those expectations had spurred increases in asset valuations and household net worth a number of participants expressed uncertainty about the magnitude of the effects of tax reform on consumer spending district contacts were optimistic and their reports were generally consistent with continued steady growth in business spending reports from district contacts about both the manufacturing and service sectors were generally positive in contrast

155,2001-08-21,minutes,the economy was likely to follow a more extended period of adjustment than had been anticipated in their earlier forecasts with regard to the outlook for inflation members reported on widespread indications of some slackening in what were still generally tight labor markets and also noted that capacity utilization rates had declined substantially in many industries the reduced pressures on resources along with expectations of some further declines in energy prices were seen by many members as likely to foster a modest deceleration in many measures of wages and prices statistical evidence of an ongoing though gradual worsening in overall business conditions was supported by anecdotal reports from around the nation weakness continued to be concentrated in manufacturing notably in the high tech sector and in high tech service industries indications that the softening was spreading more generally were still fairly limited as suggested by employment data and anecdotal reports at the same time members cited some still quite tentative signs that declines in manufacturing had slowed or that activity had steadied in some depressed industries in their review of developments in key sectors of the economy members again emphasized the ongoing strength in household spending and its vital role in moderating the weakness in overall economic activity tax rebates declining energy prices and widespread discounting of retail prices were cited as positive factors in support of consumer spending on a wide range of goods and services in addition increasingly persuasive evidence indicated that realized capital gains from the sale of homes were a source of fairly significant amounts of consumer purchasing power in the economy looking ahead members expressed some concern about how long the household sector would continue to prop up the economy in the absence of an upturn in business expenditures while accommodative financial conditions and reduced income tax rates should continue to undergird consumer spending and the data on retail sales for july displayed relatively impressive gains negative wealth effects from falling stock market prices declining payrolls and sluggish income gains should they persist might well depress consumer expenditures over coming months in this regard some recent anecdotal reports pointed to weaker retail sales importantly including motor vehicles there also were some recent indications of declining consumer confidence and many retailers had become less optimistic about the outlook for

of robust expansion m2 grew at a slower pace in june and available data implied a slight contraction in july most of the weakness owed to a slowdown in liquid deposit growth that was related in part to the decline in mortgage refinancing activity in addition retail money market funds resumed their earlier decline currency growth however strengthened over the two months partly as a result of a pickup in foreign demand the staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the economy would continue to expand at a solid pace through 2005 supported by a relatively accommodative monetary policy over the projection period and by stimulative fiscal policy through 2004 consumer spending was expected to strengthen in the near term boosted by strong consumer confidence and rising disposable income which would likely continue to be propelled by robust growth in structural productivity favorable financial conditions higher profits and the partial expensing tax incentives over the remainder of this year were projected to lead to a near term acceleration in business fixed investment subsequently growth in capital spending was expected to moderate somewhat but still to remain on a healthy upward trajectory despite recent weakness in employment growth the waning of firms unusual caution of recent years was expected to foster a pickup in hiring over the next several quarters consumer price inflation was projected to remain low over the forecast period as the sharp increases in energy and import prices experienced earlier in the year partially unwound slack resource utilization through 2005 was also expected to help hold down inflation in the FOMC s discussion of current and prospective economic developments members noted that the pace of the expansion had moderated in particular consumer spending which had previously provided considerable support to aggregate demand had slowed sharply in the second quarter at the same time growth in payrolls had fallen back in june and july after posting significant gains in the spring while the recent moderation in growth might portend a substantially slower expansion going forward than had previously been expected

159,1993-05-18,minutes,substantial uncertainty stemming to an important extent from the unsettled course of legislation aimed at reducing the federal deficit members expressed particular concern about the rise in various measures of inflation over the past several months the increase seemed to reflect temporary factors and a worsening in inflationary expectations rather than any significant change in economic fundamentals accordingly it was premature in the view of many members to conclude that the inflationary trend had tilted upward even so higher inflation expectations if sustained would be detrimental to economic performance and the risks of an uptrend in inflation clearly had increased in their review of business developments across the nation members continued to report uneven conditions ranging from apparently moderate gains in some parts of the country to mixed or marginally declining activity in others business confidence had deteriorated in many areas and firms were trimming or putting on hold new or expanded spending programs pending a resolution of federal tax and spending proposals including prospective health care reform and the outcome of proposed tax legislation in some states as well cautious business attitudes were reflected in continuing efforts to constrain costs and to hold down or reduce employment levels notably of permanent workers in light of the large non wage costs associated with full time workers accordingly while some job growth was occurring especially outside major firms and the defense sector business firms generally appeared disposed to continue to meet increases in demand through overtime work and temporary workers and members anticipated that such attitudes were likely to persist in the absence of a major improvement in business confidence as reflected in the available data for the national economy anecdotal reports from around the country suggested generally lackluster retail sales over the first four months of the year to an extent this development probably involved some retrenchment in consumer spending following an unsustainable surge during the latter part of 1992 in some parts of the country unusually severe weather conditions also had served to hold down retail sales earlier this year and recovery from that slowdown had tended to be limited thus far especially outside the automotive sector looking ahead the members continued to anticipate that consumer spending would provide moderate support for a sustained economic expansion despite the cautious business attitudes about the economic outlook spending for business equipment had continued to help maintain the expansion encouraged in part,stimulus initiative seemed unlikely enacted congress although outlook fiscal policy

program were significant and apparently reflected shifts out of savings accounts as well as redirection of funds by banks customers away from other money market instruments currency continued its strong increase apparently boosted by solid foreign demand for u s banknotes liquidity conditions in the money markets of major foreign economies improved but remained strained over the intermeeting period movements in stock prices were mixed in the advanced foreign economies although equity prices generally rose in emerging market economies in response to evidence of a slowdown in economic activity and a rapid waning of inflationary pressures central banks around the world eased policy sharply sovereign bond yields fell reflecting prospects for lower inflation and lower policy rates for

activity in 2009 but continued to project a moderate recovery in 2010 real gdp appeared likely to decline substantially in the fourth quarter of 2008 as conditions in the labor market deteriorated more steeply than previously anticipated the decline in industrial production intensified consumer and business spending appeared to weaken and financial conditions on balance continued to tighten

165,2019-01-30,minutes,than necessary for efficient and effective implementation of monetary policy if so many suggested that some further very gradual decline in the average level of reserves reflecting the trend growth of other liabilities such as federal reserve notes in circulation could be appropriate in these participants view this process would allow the federal reserve to arrive slowly at an efficient level of reserves while maintaining good control of short term interest rates without needing to engage in more frequent open market operations a few participants judged that there would be little benefit to allowing reserves to continue to fall after the end of redemptions or that this approach could have costs such as an undue risk of volatility in short term interest rates that would exceed its benefits these participants thought that upon ending asset redemptions the federal reserve should begin adding to its assets to offset growth in nonreserve liabilities so as to keep the average level of reserves relatively stable a couple of participants suggested that a ceiling facility to mitigate temporary unexpected pressures in reserve markets could play a useful role in supporting policy implementation at lower levels of reserves participants commented that in light of the FOMC s longstanding plan to hold primarily treasury securities in the long run it would be appropriate once asset redemptions end to reinvest most if not all principal payments received from agency mbs in treasury securities some thought that continuing to reinvest agency mbs principal payments in excess of 20 billion per month in agency mbs as under the current balance sheet normalization plan would simplify communications or provide a helpful backstop against scenarios in which large declines in long term interest rates caused agency mbs prepayment speeds to increase sharply however some others judged that retaining the cap on agency mbs redemptions was unnecessary at this stage in the normalization process these participants noted considerations in support of this view including that principal payments were unlikely to reach the 20 billion level after 2019 that the cap could slightly slow the return to a portfolio of primarily treasury securities or that the FOMC would have the flexibility to adjust the details of its balance sheet normalization plans in light of economic and financial developments participants commented that it would be important over time to develop and communicate plans for reinvesting agency mbs principal payments and they expected to

172,1999-11-16,minutes,in the FOMC s discussion of current and prospective economic developments members commented that the statistical and anecdotal information that had become available since the october meeting continued to point to robust growth in overall economic activity despite some indications of softening in interest sensitive sectors of the economy although productivity developments remained quite favorable the faster rise in productivity itself apparently had tended to bolster demand more than supply through its effects on equity prices and consumption and on the demand for capital equipment while real interest rates had risen to some extent to restore balance between supply and demand they evidently had not risen enough or had not been high for long enough and growth at an unsustainable pace continued to ratchet up pressures in labor markets abstracting from possible temporary fluctuations associated with the upcoming century date change the members saw few signs of significant slowing in aggregate demand over the next few months over a somewhat longer horizon however they believed that growth in aggregate demand was likely to moderate to a more sustainable pace that would bring it into closer balance with the expansion in aggregate supply key factors cited by the members in support of their expectations of slower growth in overall domestic spending were the lagged and to some extent already evident effects of the rise that had occurred in long term interest rates including mortgage rates and the effects on business and consumer sentiment of a less buoyant stock market should the latter persist however the recent depreciation of the dollar and the ongoing strengthening of many foreign economies would stimulate rising export demand and perhaps substantially reduce the drag exerted on the economy by the foreign trade sector the members acknowledged that their forecasts were subject to a substantial degree of uncertainty but the risks on balance were seen as tilted toward growth strong enough to put added pressures on already tight labor markets increasing pressures on labor resources should they materialize would at some point foster larger increases in labor costs with potentially adverse implications for price inflation over time with regard to the prospective performance of key sectors of the economy forecasts of somewhat slower growth in consumer spending appeared to be supported by recent reports of some moderation in sales of motor vehicles from extraordinarily high levels anecdotal reports relating to recent retail

ongoing slack in resource utilization some downward pressure on core price inflation was considered a risk in the staff forecast in their review of current and prospective economic developments members commented that they were encouraged by the recent data on economic activity and the tone of related anecdotal commentary in their view these developments in the context of stimulative fiscal and monetary policies receptive financial conditions and apparently improving business and consumer confidence had brightened the prospects for substantial further strengthening of the economy the members acknowledged that the magnitude of the improvement remained subject to considerable uncertainty notably with regard to the prospects for business expenditures and they cited both upside and downside risks to forecasts of a more vigorous expansion concerning the prospects for inflation members expressed the view that even if growth somewhat above the economy s potential were to materialize over the next several quarters which many regarded as a likely scenario substantial excess margins of labor and other resources would remain and would continue to hold down overall inflation indeed a number of members saw merit in the staff forecast that some further disinflation was a likely prospect in such circumstances members commented that current financial conditions remained a positive factor in the outlook for the economy even after the recent rise in long term interest rates to be sure the increase would have some restraining effect indeed mortgage refinancing activity appeared to have declined substantially according to some reports prospectively lessening the support for some consumer and other spending fostered by the extraction of equity from housing

176,2013-10-30,minutes,as weighing on business planning participants generally saw the direct economic effects of the partial shutdown of the federal government as temporary and limited but a number of them expressed concern about the possible economic effects of repeated fiscal impasses on business and consumer confidence more broadly fiscal policy which has been exerting significant restraint on economic growth was expected to become somewhat less restrictive over the forecast period nonetheless it was noted that the stance of fiscal policy was likely to remain one of the most important headwinds restraining growth over the medium term although a number of participants indicated that the september employment report was somewhat disappointing they judged that the labor market continued to improve albeit slowly the limited pace of gains in wages and payrolls as well as the number of employees working part time for economic reasons were mentioned as evidence of substantial remaining slack in the labor market the drop in the unemployment rate over the past year while welcome and significant could overstate the degree of improvement in labor market conditions in part because of the decline in the labor force participation rate however a few participants offered reasons why recent readings on the unemployment rate might provide an accurate assessment on balance of the extent of improvement in the labor market for instance if the decline in labor force participation reflected decisions to retire it was unlikely to be reversed because retirees were unlikely to return to the labor force furthermore a secular decline in labor market dynamism or turnover might have contributed to a reduction in the size of normal monthly payroll gains finally revised data showed that the historical relationship between real gdp growth and changes in the unemployment rate had remained broadly in place in recent years suggesting that the unemployment rate continued to provide a reasonably accurate signal about the strength of the labor market and the degree of slack in the economy available information suggested that inflation remained subdued and below the FOMC s longer run objective of 2 percent similarly longer run inflation expectations remained stable and by some measures below 2 percent financial conditions eased notably over the intermeeting period with

it anticipates that inflation will move back toward its objective over the medium term taking into account the extent of federal fiscal retrenchment over the past year the FOMC sees the improvement in economic activity and labor market conditions since it began its asset purchase program as consistent with growing underlying strength in the broader economy however the FOMC decided to await more evidence that progress will be sustained before adjusting the pace of its purchases accordingly the FOMC decided to continue purchasing additional agency mortgage backed securities at a pace of 40 billion per month and longer term treasury securities at a pace of 45 billion per month the FOMC is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities in agency mortgage backed securities and of rolling over maturing treasury securities at auction taken together these actions should maintain downward pressure on longer term interest rates support mortgage markets and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation over time is at the rate most consistent with the FOMC s dual mandate the FOMC will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months and will continue its purchases of treasury and agency mortgage backed securities and employ its other policy tools as appropriate until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability in judging when to moderate the pace of asset purchases the FOMC will at its coming meetings assess whether incoming information continues to support the FOMC s expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer run objective asset purchases are not on a preset course and the FOMC s decisions about their pace will remain contingent on the FOMC s economic outlook as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases to support continued progress toward maximum employment and price

firming in wage pressures led many members to conclude that recent price developments did not provide persuasive evidence of a change in the inflation outlook members continued to report somewhat uneven business conditions across the nation steady economic growth characterized many parts of the country but business activity remained depressed in some areas and industries notably those related to defense aerospace and nonresidential construction while business sentiment was generally positive many business contacts were uncertain about the outlook for demand in their own industries or the potential strength of the overall expansion and recent fiscal policy developments appeared to have introduced a further note of caution this uncertainty helped to account for the continuing reliance of numerous firms on overtime work to meet growing demand rather than incurring the considerable costs of adding new workers even so an increasing number of contacts were reporting worker recalls or new hires one member commented that job growth could be viewed both as a measure of business sentiment and as a necessary element in building or maintaining consumer confidence and thus helping to ensure an enduring economic expansion the quickening recovery during 1992 especially in the second half of the year had received considerable impetus from consumer spending and while growth in such spending could be expected to moderate from its pace in recent quarters the consumer sector was viewed as likely to play a key role in sustaining the expansion this year many consumers had taken advantage of steep declines in interest rates to strengthen their balance sheets and reduce their debt service burdens and they were now in a much improved position to finance further growth in their expenditures the members took note of recent indications of a decline in consumer confidence and of some softening in retail sales since early in the year however the latter appeared to be in part the result of recently adverse weather conditions in some major parts of the country and consumer confidence was still much improved on balance since earlier in the recovery accordingly recent developments were not seen in themselves as harbingers of a weakening consumer spending trend over the next several quarters business spending on producers durable equipment also was believed

179,2005-11-01,minutes,that with appropriate monetary policy action the upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal the FOMC noted that the widespread devastation in the gulf region from hurricane katrina the associated dislocation of economic activity and the boost to energy prices would set back spending production and employment in the near term however the FOMC judged that these unfortunate developments did not pose a more persistent threat to the overall economy rather monetary policy accommodation coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity was providing ongoing support to economic activity although higher energy and other costs had the potential to add to inflation pressure core inflation had been relatively low in the preceding few months and longer term inflation expectations remained contained in these circumstances the FOMC believed that policy accommodation could be removed at a pace that would likely be measured but noted that it would respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability with investors putting only small odds on a pause in the tightening cycle following hurricane katrina there was little market reaction to the FOMC s decision at the september meeting however the expected path for monetary policy shifted up in subsequent weeks as incoming data indicated that output had been expanding briskly prior to the hurricanes and that the disruptions to economic activity from the hurricanes were likely to be less severe than initially feared this upward pressure on interest rates may have been amplified by comments from a number of federal reserve officials that were read as stressing inflation concerns nominal treasury yields rose in line with the shift in the outlook for monetary policy despite a large increase in the overall consumer price index for september measures of inflation compensation

186,2010-01-27,minutes,participants expressed a range of views about asset sales most judged that a future program of gradual asset sales could be helpful in shrinking the size of the federal reserve s balance sheet reducing reserve balances and shifting the composition of securities holdings back toward treasury securities however many were concerned that such transactions could cause market disruptions and have adverse implications for the economic recovery particularly if they were to begin before the recovery had become self sustaining and before the FOMC had determined that a tightening of financial conditions was appropriate and had begun to raise short term interest rates several thought it important to begin a program of asset sales in the near future to ensure that the federal reserve s balance sheet shrinks more quickly and in a more predictable manner than could be achieved solely by redeeming maturing securities and not reinvesting prepayments they judged that a program of asset sales spread over a number of years would underscore the FOMC s determination to exit from the period of exceptionally accommodative monetary policy in a manner and at a pace that would keep inflation contained without having large effects on asset prices or market interest rates a few suggested that the pace of asset sales and potentially of purchases could be adjusted over time in response to developments in the economy and the evolution of the economic outlook the FOMC made no decisions about asset sales at this meeting staff review of the economic situation the information reviewed at the january 26 27 meeting suggested that economic activity continued to strengthen in recent months consumer spending was well maintained in the fourth quarter and business

current and prospective economic developments members commented that the recent statistical and anecdotal information had been mixed but they viewed evolving business conditions as consistent on the whole with a continued softness in economic activity members noted that consumer spending had strengthened early in the year and housing activity had remained at a relatively high level these positive developments needed to be weighed against an appreciable weakening in business investment spending and the near term restraining effects of a drawdown in inventories looking ahead while sales and production data suggested that excess inventories were being worked off the adjustment did not appear to have been completed beyond the inventory correction the members continued to anticipate an acceleration of the expansion over time though likely on a more delayed basis and at a more gradual pace than they had forecast earlier they noted a number of favorable underlying factors that would tend to support a rebound including solid productivity growth stable low inflation generally sound financial institutions lower interest rates and relatively robust expansion in many measures of money however the members saw clear downside risks in the outlook for consumer and investment spending in the context of the marked decline that had occurred in equity prices and consumer confidence and in expected business profitability and they were concerned that weaker exports might also hold down the expansion of economic activity with regard to the outlook for inflation some recent measures of increases in core prices had fluctuated on the high side of earlier expectations but apart from energy prices and medical costs inflation was still relatively quiescent with the growth in output likely to remain below the expansion of the economy s potential for a while members anticipated that inflation would remain subdued mirroring the statistics for the nation as a whole business

prepared for this meeting the economy was seen as likely to expand next year at around this year s solid pace under an assumption of generally accommodative financial conditions recent declines in the dollar were expected to support domestic economic activity by boosting net exports fiscal policy was expected to become much less stimulative after the current quarter owing to the expiration of the

191,1996-07-02,minutes,gains in this segment of business spending housing was seen as another important sector of the economy that was likely to exert a retarding effect on the expansion as the rise that had occurred in mortgage interest rates was felt increasingly in housing markets the anecdotal information from around the nation and the available statistics suggested however that those markets generally had remained surprisingly ebullient thus far and there were only limited indications of some softening in home construction activity business inventory investment was viewed as a key upside risk in the economic outlook for coming quarters an inventory overhang at the end of last year had been corrected in the first quarter and inventory investment was indicated to have turned positive again in the second quarter however current inventory to sales ratios appeared to be relatively lean and final sales that exceeded current expectations might well induce a sharp upward adjustment in inventory accumulation especially if lead times were to lengthen and producers perceived shortfalls in their safety stocks members viewed the outlook for inflation as a source of substantial uncertainty in their forecasts though many saw reasonable prospects that a rate of economic expansion in line with their forecasts and associated levels of capacity utilization would prove to be consistent with little change in the core rate of inflation some important measures of price inflation after adjustment to exclude their volatile food and energy components had shown a flat or even a declining trend in recent quarters the outlook for overall price increases would remain contingent in part on food and energy price developments but more importantly on underlying cost pressures in the economy several members commented that the levels of utilization of capital and labor resources that had prevailed over the past couple of years would have been expected on the basis of past historical patterns to foster rising cost pressures and greater inflation however labor compensation gains had been subdued in relation to earlier cyclical experience likely as a consequence of increased worker concerns about job security and job opportunities despite the continued low rate of unemployment and widespread anecdotal reports of tight labor markets across the country there were

194,1999-10-05,minutes,the other hand foreign economies were strengthening more quickly than anticipated and rising exports were likely to offset part of the slowdown in domestic demand the implications of continued robust growth for the inflation outlook depended critically on judgments about the supply side of the economy productivity and economic potential seemed to have been growing at an increasingly rapid rate in recent years that acceleration had itself tended to boost consumption and investment demand in complex interactions of aggregate supply and demand but it also had held down increases in unit costs and prices a great deal of uncertainty surrounded the behavior of productivity growth going forward but some further pickup and the associated ability of the economy to accommodate more rapid growth without added inflation was a possibility that could not be overlooked however a further pickup in productivity growth was by no means assured and a number of other favorable developments in supply and prices that had acted to restrain inflation in recent years had already begun to dissipate or reverse these included the substantial upturn in energy prices the ebbing of import price declines and the pickup in health care costs adverse trends in the latter two factors in particular were likely to be extended in these circumstances members generally saw some risk of rising inflation going forward but they also recognized that similar forecasts in recent years had proved wrong and that considerable uncertainty surrounded expectations of somewhat higher core inflation in their review of developments across the nation members reported continued high levels of activity in all regions and few indications of moderating growth though agriculture remained relatively depressed in many areas the anecdotal information from around the nation clearly supported the overall statistical evidence of persisting strength in key components of domestic demand consumer spending notably for light motor vehicles was continuing to rise at a brisk pace some of the strength in consumer durables was related to purchases associated with homebuilding which though likely to slacken a little owing to the rise in mortgage interest rates seemed to be staying at a high level while consumer spending probably would be sustained by further anticipated growth in employment and incomes the pause in the stock market should it persist and the attendant effects on financial wealth were expected with some lag to damp further gains in consumer expenditures business

homes remained elevated relative to the pace of sales sales of existing single family homes dropped less than sales of new homes in november and turned up in december but the relative strength in

203,1994-09-27,minutes,slowing in the pace of the expansion as a reasonable expectation though they acknowledged that signs of such slowing currently were limited and in particular that the most recent data indicated a greater probability of somewhat more strength in aggregate demand than had appeared to be developing during the late spring and early summer the policy tightening actions implemented earlier in the year seemed to have elicited only a mild response thus far in interest sensitive sectors of the economy however much of the retarding effects of those actions including the recent sizable tightening in august probably had not yet been felt in the economy in light of the strength of aggregate demand and lags in the effects of policy the risks of some rise in inflation rates probably had increased how large this rise might be or when it might be reversed was very difficult to predict at this point however indications of a persisting pickup in inflation would be a matter of considerable concern and further developments would need to be monitored with special care in light of the FOMC s longstanding commitment to containing inflation and moving over time toward price stability to foster the maximum sustainable performance of the economy in their review of developments across the nation members commented on high levels of business activity in many regions and many of them referred to increasing reports of scarcities of specific types of labor resources after softening earlier in many areas business conditions appeared to have strengthened in a number of regions during recent weeks while displaying little change or continued moderate growth elsewhere robust expansion in manufacturing activity especially in the motor vehicle and related industries was a notable feature of recent business developments on the financial side the overall expansion of credit had remained moderate but many members stressed the ready availability of financing from increasingly aggressive bank lenders moreover despite higher interest rates capital markets were providing continued support to a wide variety of borrowers the constraints on the availability of credit and the reluctance of many borrowers to incur new debt factors that had tended to retard the recovery during its earlier stages had given way to a financial climate that might even be providing

continued decreases in prices of non energy imports however energy prices appeared to have stabilized participants continued to project a gradual rise in inflation toward 2 percent over the medium term as the labor market improved further and the transitory effects of earlier declines in energy and import prices dissipated in discussing how to interpret the reported weakness in real gdp during the first quarter participants considered alternative estimates of real economic activity based on various data filtering models maintained by board and reserve bank staff these models yielded a range of estimates but overall they suggested that real activity in the first quarter was likely stronger than the then current official estimate of real gdp some participants indicated that the higher alternative estimates seemed more consistent with the increases in real gross domestic income and private domestic final purchases in the first quarter as well as the strength in employment and hours worked however the alternative estimates left open the question of when and to what extent the seasonal adjustment and other measurement issues associated with official estimates of gdp in the first quarter might unwind while participants generally saw the risks to their projections of economic activity and the labor market as balanced they gave a number of reasons to be cautious in assessing the outlook some pointed to the risk that the weaker than anticipated rise in economic activity over the first half of the year could reflect factors that might continue to restrain sales and production and that economic activity might not have sufficient momentum to sustain progress toward the FOMC s objectives in particular they were concerned that consumers could remain cautious or that the drag on sectors affected by lower energy prices and the higher dollar could persist others however viewed the strength in the labor market in recent months as potentially signaling a stronger than expected bounceback in economic activity several mentioned their uncertainty about whether greece and its official creditors would reach an agreement and about the likely pace of economic growth abroad

substantially reduced and the size of business capital stocks apparently had continued to move closer to acceptable levels as a consequence improving sales and profits low financing costs and the temporary federal tax incentive for investment in new equipment and software were projected to boost business investment spending over time given the substantial ongoing slack in resource utilization the staff forecast anticipated some slight downward pressure on core consumer price inflation in the FOMC s discussion of current and prospective economic developments members referred to widespread indications of a marked strengthening in the growth of economic activity while views regarding the probable vigor of the expansion differed to some extent the members generally anticipated growth at a pace near or somewhat above the economy s potential over the forecast horizon assuming no major shocks to the economy factors cited as likely to encourage robust and sustained economic growth included substantial fiscal and monetary policy stimulus accommodative financial conditions indications of strengthening foreign economies much improved business earnings and cash flows and the favorable implications of strongly rising productivity for business investment and worker earnings members nonetheless saw some factors that could restrain the degree of vigor in household and business spending and present downside risks to their forecasts among the negatives mentioned were the still cautious business attitudes that continued to inhibit hiring and investment decisions the potentially adverse effect on household confidence if appreciable further gains in employment should fail to materialize and the waning impetus over time of the tax reductions that had taken effect this year on balance while the factors pointing to a vigorous expansion seemed to predominate members acknowledged that the economy was emerging from an atypical period that limited the guidance that historical experience provided for evaluating the economic outlook developments in the next few months notably including the strength of holiday sales should provide an improved basis for judging the underlying momentum of

214,1998-09-29,minutes,conditions were to persist the sustainability of the current strength in business capital expenditures would come into question the decline in stock market prices also appeared likely to damp the growth of consumer spending over time with added implications for business capital expenditures despite the emergence of decidedly less hospitable financial conditions there were few indications in the data available to the FOMC of any weakening as yet in consumer and business spending consumer expenditures though temporarily held back by shortages of new motor vehicles stemming from the work stoppage at general motors had remained on a solid uptrend with overall growth in recent months apparently slipping only a little from a remarkably rapid pace in the first half of the year strong growth in jobs and incomes along with substantial further increases in stock market prices through mid july had fostered a high level of consumer confidence and spending members commented that the more recent weakness in the stock market and the related decline in household net worth had removed an important support for the growth of consumer spending but they noted that recent surveys indicated only a slight deterioration in consumer sentiment and that the stimulus from earlier stock market gains probably would dissipate only gradually looking further ahead consumer spending could be expected to expand at a pace that was more in line with the growth of household incomes than it had been in recent years growth in business investment spending while apparently moderating from an extraordinary pace during the first half of the year likewise seemed to have been little affected to date by the tightening in credit conditions and the increased aversion to risktaking data on shipments of capital equipment continued to display a clear uptrend and members reported very strong construction activity in many parts of the country declining relative prices and rapid technological advances were likely to generate appreciable further growth in spending for computer and office equipment over the projection horizon moreover new orders for capital equipment did not suggest any general weakening though such orders had declined dramatically in the steel industry under the weight of intense foreign competition even so the members anticipated that the pronounced

asset purchase program were largely anticipated but yields on treasury securities rose slightly as a few investors apparently had seen some chance that the FOMC would expand the purchase program the release of the april fomc minutes three weeks later prompted a reversal of this move as market participants reportedly focused on the suggestion that the total size of the purchase program might need to be increased at some point to spur a more rapid pace of recovery the expected path of the federal funds rate implied by futures prices was largely unchanged by the release of the FOMC s statement and minutes however in the days following the release of the may employment report which was read as being significantly less negative than anticipated market participants marked up their expected path for the federal funds rate yields on nominal treasury coupon securities increased on net over the intermeeting period these moves likely reflected a number of factors including investors perceptions of an improvement in the economic outlook decreased concerns about the risk of deflation a reversal of flight to quality flows and selling of long duration assets as exposure to mortgage prepayment risk dropped with a rise in mortgage rates in addition inflation compensation rose over the intermeeting period as yields on inflation indexed treasury securities increased much less than those on their nominal counterparts some of the rise in inflation compensation may have reflected an increase in inflation expectations but an improvement in liquidity in the market for treasury inflation protected securities and mortgage related hedging flows may have boosted inflation compensation as well pressures in short term bank funding markets eased further as evidenced by declines in

to be less than last year on the other hand uncertainty about the direction of some economic policies was judged to have remained elevated the staff saw the risks to the forecasts for real gdp growth and the unemployment rate as balanced the risks to the projection for inflation were also seen as balanced downside risks included the possibilities that longer term inflation expectations may have edged down or that the recent run of soft inflation readings could prove to be more persistent than the staff expected these downside risks were seen as essentially counterbalanced by the upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to continue operating above its longer run potential participants views on current conditions and the economic outlook in conjunction with this fomc meeting members of the board of governors and federal reserve bank presidents submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real output growth the unemployment rate and inflation for each year from 2017 through 2020 and over the longer run based on their individual assessments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate 6 the longer run

to the economy these projections and policy assessments are described in the summary of economic projections which is an addendum to these minutes in their discussion of the economic situation and the

221,2000-11-15,minutes,m2 followed strong expansion in august and september however and growth since midyear was at about the same pace as in the first half of the year m3 also increased at a slower rate in october partly reflecting weakness in bank lending and declines in bank holdings of securities the growth of domestic nonfinancial debt picked up in september in association with an increase in the pace of private borrowing and a less rapid paydown of federal debt the staff forecast prepared for this meeting suggested that the economic expansion having slowed considerably would be sustained over the forecast horizon at a rate a little below the staff s current estimate of the economy s potential output the forecast anticipated that the expansion of domestic final demand would be held back to some extent by the waning influence of the positive wealth effects associated with past outsized gains in equity prices but also by some firming of conditions in credit markets as a result growth of spending on consumer durables was expected to be appreciably below that in recent quarters and housing demand to trend slightly downward by contrast business fixed investment notably outlays for equipment and software was projected to remain relatively robust and brisk growth abroad would undergird the expansion of u s exports core price inflation was projected to rise a little over the forecast horizon in part as a result of higher import prices but largely as a consequence of further increases in nominal labor compensation gains that would not be fully offset by growth in productivity in the FOMC s discussion of current and prospective economic conditions members commented that the information that had become available since the previous meeting had reinforced earlier indications of appreciable slowing in the expansion of economic activity the cumulating evidence of moderating expansion seemed especially clear in the information on employment growth and manufacturing output aggregate demand currently appeared to be growing at a pace a little below the rate of increase in the economy s output potential a configuration that could well persist in coming

223,2002-01-30,minutes,policy measures might be available their efficacy was uncertain and it might be impossible to ease monetary policy sufficiently through the usual interest rate process to achieve system objectives the members agreed that the potential for such an economic and policy scenario seemed highly remote but it could not be dismissed altogether if in the future such circumstances appeared to be in the process of materializing a case could be made at that point for taking preemptive easing actions to help guard against the potential development of economic weakness and price declines that could be associated with the so called zero bound policy constraint the FOMC then turned to a discussion of the economic and financial outlook and the implementation of monetary policy over the intermeeting period ahead the information reviewed at this meeting indicated that economic activity probably steadied in the fourth quarter after a sizable drop in the summer final demand appeared to have increased appreciably reflecting strength in consumer spending and a smaller decline in business purchases of durable equipment and software however businesses met a good part of the pickup in final demand through a large runoff of inventories and as a consequence manufacturing activity and payroll employment continued to weaken late in the year though at a slower pace falling energy prices and widespread discounting of goods held down consumer price inflation the labor market deteriorated somewhat further in december and the unemployment rate continued to climb to 5 8 percent private nonfarm payrolls fell considerably with manufacturing again experiencing the largest job losses but the decrease was less than in previous months and aggregate hours

participants regarded the information received during the intermeeting period as indicating that economic activity and employment continued to expand at a moderate pace apart from weather related disruptions the unemployment rate had declined somewhat since the summer but remained elevated although household spending had continued to advance growth in business fixed investment had slowed the housing sector had shown further signs of improvement consumer price inflation had been running somewhat below the FOMC s longer run objective of 2 percent apart from temporary variations that largely reflected fluctuations in energy prices and longer term inflation expectations had remained stable in their assessments of the economic outlook many participants thought that the pace of economic expansion would remain moderate in 2013 before picking up gradually in 2014 and 2015 this outlook was little changed from their projections at recent meetings hurricane sandy was expected to weigh on economic growth in the current quarter but rebuilding could provide some temporary impetus early in 2013 participants forecasts which generally were conditioned on the view that it would be appropriate to maintain a highly accommodative monetary policy for a considerable time included an outlook for a continued gradual decline in the unemployment rate toward levels judged to be consistent with the FOMC s mandate over the longer run with inflation running near the FOMC s 2 percent longer run goal participants observed that growth in economic activity continued to be restrained by several persistent headwinds including ongoing deleveraging on the part of households and still tight credit conditions for some borrowers and that a major headwind facing the economy at present appeared to be uncertainty about u s fiscal policy and the outcome of the ongoing negotiations on federal spending and taxes while participants generally saw it as likely that the congress and the administration would avert the full force of the tax increases and spending cuts scheduled to occur in 2013 almost all indicated that heightened uncertainty about fiscal policy probably was affecting economic activity adversely for example it likely had reduced household and business confidence and led firms to defer hiring and investment spending some participants noted that an early

226,1994-05-17,minutes,indications both statistical and anecdotal of considerable momentum in the economic expansion business activity seemed to be rebounding smartly from the disruptive effects of unusually severe winter weather and it appeared that the expansion over the first half of the year was likely to be a little stronger than had been expected at the time of the march meeting a deceleration in activity still seemed to be in train for the second half but the extent of such a slowing was an important source of uncertainty in the outlook the members continued to see moderate growth at a rate in line with or slightly above the economy s potential as the most likely prospect but the overall momentum of the expansion and the still accommodative stance of monetary policy suggested that there was an appreciable risk of faster growth for a period with consequent implications for greater pressures on resources at the same time the members saw relatively few signs of the kinds of imbalances that would pose a significant downside potential for the economy although some cautioned that the rise in long term interest rates recently weaker data on production and sales and continuing anxiety about job security in an environment of corporate restructuring contributed elements of fragility to what was otherwise a healthy outlook the near term prospects for inflation were favorable wage and price trends generally remained moderate the persisting high rate of business investment bode well for further enhancements of productivity and competitive pressures including those from imported goods were restraining efforts by firms to raise prices the members were concerned however that in an environment in which slack in the economy already had been reduced to a fairly low level and could decline further in the quarters ahead inflation could begin to rise unless monetary policy were adjusted further from its accommodative stance in their comments about developments across the nation members took note of the considerable strength in economic conditions in many parts of the country however they also recognized that some parts of the nation were experiencing

factors tending to boost the upside risks to their inflation outlook though on net they saw the risks to stable underlying inflation as still balanced in their discussion of important sectors of the economy participants noted that increasing equity and home prices had boosted household net worth leaving consumers well positioned to maintain a brisk pace of spending continued gains in employment were thought likely to provide additional support to spending by bolstering consumer confidence and income participants commented that real disposable incomes should receive a further lift from the recent drop in oil prices moreover intermediate and long term interest rates remained low in both nominal and real terms despite the recent firming in the stance of policy encouraging spending on

the sense of caution previously evident in business spending and hiring behavior seemed to be waning others believed that many businesses remained quite wary most participants acknowledged some significant uncertainties in their outlook including the effects of the expiration of the partial expensing provision for investment at the end of 2004 and recent indications of a softening in high

especially uncertain and the weakness could be greater than previously anticipated owing to renewed turmoil in emerging asian economies and pronounced weakness in japan whether the moderation in u s economic growth would be sufficient to forestall cost increases arising from tight labor markets that in turn would add to pressures on prices was open to question to date developments in business costs had been relatively benign owing to an important extent to somewhat faster productivity growth this circumstance and a number of one time influences holding down costs and prices had contained inflation at rates that were lower than those seen in several decades and probably would continue to do so for a while but the members generally were concerned that inflation might begin to rise over the intermediate term especially if labor markets tightened further in their assessment of the factors underlying the persisting strength of aggregate final demand members took particular note of the effect of accommodative financial conditions the rapid growth in consumer spending was being bolstered by large gains in stock market wealth and the strength in housing and other interest sensitive consumer expenditures also reflected declines in nominal and perhaps in real intermediate and long term interest rates and the ample availability of loans likewise the ready availability of equity and debt financing on favorable terms was a key factor in the continuing robust growth of business investment indeed some members expressed concern that the widespread perceptions of reduced risk or complacency that had bolstered equity prices beyond levels that seemed justified by fundamentals were beginning to be felt in a variety of other markets as well including commercial and residential properties business ventures and land in the view of a number of members rapid growth of the monetary aggregates though it had slowed very recently was a further indication that financial conditions were not restraining economic activity despite the failure of domestic demand to moderate in line with their earlier expectations the members were persuaded that appreciable slowing in the growth of economic activity was a likely prospect over the course of coming quarters even though its exact timing and extent were unknown key elements in this assessment were the outlook for

changed on net over the intermeeting period the staff s periodic report on potential risks to financial stability concluded that relatively strong capital positions of u s banks subdued use of maturity transformation and leverage within the broader financial sector and relatively low levels of leverage for the aggregate nonfinancial sector were important factors supporting overall financial stability however the staff report also highlighted that low and declining risk premiums low levels of market volatility and a loosening of underwriting standards in a number of markets raised somewhat the risk of an eventual correction in asset valuations staff economic outlook the data received since the staff prepared its forecast for the june fomc meeting suggested that real gdp growth was even weaker in the first half of the year than had been anticipated 3 however the staff left its forecast for real gdp growth in the second half of the year essentially unrevised because other indicators of economic activity appeared comparatively strong in relation to real gdp during the first half of the year in particular payroll employment continued to advance at a solid pace the unemployment rate declined further industrial production posted steady gains and readings from business surveys were strong the staff s medium term forecast for real gdp growth was also little revised the staff continued to project that real gdp would expand at a faster pace in the second half of this year and over the next two years than in 2013 this forecast was predicated on a further anticipated waning of the restraint on spending growth from changes in fiscal policy continued improvement in credit availability increases in consumer and business confidence and a pickup in foreign economic growth in response to a further downward surprise in the unemployment rate the staff again lowered its forecast for the unemployment rate over the projection period to reconcile the downward revision to real gdp growth for the first half of year with an unemployment rate that was now closer to the staff s estimate of its longer run natural rate the staff lowered its assumed pace of

progress toward maximum employment and the improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions since the inception of the current asset purchase program the FOMC decided to make a further measured reduction in the pace of its asset purchases beginning in august the FOMC will add to its holdings of agency mortgage backed securities at a pace of 10 billion per month rather than 15 billion per month and will add to its holdings of longer term treasury securities at a pace of 15 billion per month rather than 20 billion per month the FOMC is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities in agency mortgage backed securities and of rolling over maturing treasury securities at auction the FOMC s sizable and still increasing holdings of longer term securities should maintain downward pressure on longer term interest rates support mortgage markets and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation over time is at the rate most consistent with the FOMC s dual mandate the FOMC will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months and will continue its purchases of treasury and agency mortgage backed securities and employ its other policy tools as appropriate until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability if incoming information broadly supports the FOMC s expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer run objective the FOMC will likely reduce the pace of asset purchases in further measured steps at future meetings however asset purchases are not on a preset course and the FOMC s decisions about their pace will remain contingent on the FOMC s outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases to support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability the FOMC today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of

234,2014-09-17,minutes,the staff continued to view the uncertainty around its projections for real gdp growth the unemployment rate and inflation as similar to the average over the past 20 years the risks to the forecast for real gdp growth were still seen as tilted a little to the downside as neither monetary policy nor fiscal policy was viewed as well positioned to help the economy withstand adverse shocks at the same time the staff viewed the risks around its outlook for the unemployment rate and for inflation as roughly balanced participants views on current conditions and the economic outlook in conjunction with this fomc meeting members of the board of governors and the federal reserve bank presidents submitted their projections of real output growth the unemployment rate inflation and the federal funds rate for each year from 2014 through 2017 and over the longer run conditional on each participant s assessment of appropriate monetary policy the longer run projections represent each participant s assessment of the value to which each variable would be expected to converge over time under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy these economic projections and policy assessments are described in the sep which is attached as an addendum to these minutes in their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook meeting participants viewed the information received over the intermeeting period as suggesting that economic activity was expanding at a moderate rate on balance labor market conditions improved somewhat further however the unemployment rate was little changed and most participants judged that there remained significant underutilization of labor resources participants generally expected that over the medium term real economic activity would increase at a pace sufficient to lead to a further gradual decline in the unemployment rate toward levels consistent with the FOMC s objective of maximum employment inflation was running below the FOMC s longer run objective but longer term inflation expectations were stable participants anticipated that inflation would move toward the FOMC s 2 percent goal in coming years with several expressing concern that inflation might persist below the FOMC s objective for quite some time most viewed the risks to the outlook for economic activity and

235,2014-09-17,statement,early this year the FOMC currently judges that there is sufficient underlying strength in the broader economy to support ongoing improvement in labor market conditions in light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions since the inception of the current asset purchase program the FOMC decided to make a further measured reduction in the pace of its asset purchases beginning in october the FOMC will add to its holdings of agency mortgage backed securities at a pace of 5 billion per month rather than 10 billion per month and will add to its holdings of longer term treasury securities at a pace of 10 billion per month rather than 15 billion per month the FOMC is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities in agency mortgage backed securities and of rolling over maturing treasury securities at auction the FOMC s sizable and still increasing holdings of longer term securities should maintain downward pressure on longer term interest rates support mortgage markets and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation over time is at the rate most consistent with the FOMC s dual mandate the FOMC will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months and will continue its purchases of treasury and agency mortgage backed securities and employ its other policy tools as appropriate until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability if incoming information broadly supports the FOMC s expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer run objective the FOMC will end its current program of asset purchases at its next meeting however asset purchases are not on a preset course and the FOMC s decisions about their pace will remain contingent on the FOMC s outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases to support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability the FOMC today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy remains appropriate in determining how long to maintain the current 0 to 1 4 percent target range for the federal,investment advancing recovery housing sector remains slow fiscal

would continue to be damped by further increases in the trade deficit though the offset from this source might well diminish if financial markets and economies in key developing nations were to exhibit more signs of stabilization or improvement given the persistence of robust growth in domestic demand and the continuing forward momentum in u s economic activity many of the members commented that the risks to their forecasts were tilted toward the eventual emergence of somewhat greater inflation pressures despite the persistence of very tight labor markets across the nation however there currently were only scattered indications of more rapid increases in wages and no evidence of rising price inflation the reasons underlying this remarkable economic performance were potentially transitory but also possibly of a longer term nature lower oil and other input prices had played a role however it also seemed likely that accelerating productivity helped to account for the economy s ability to sustain not only higher rates of growth of output but also relatively low levels of unemployment at least for a time without generating higher inflation in their review of developments across the nation the members reported sustained and in some areas rising overall growth in regional economic activity at the same time some sectors were continuing to experience varying degrees of softness notably those most affected by developments abroad such as manufacturing agriculture and energy a number of members referred however to signs of recent improvement in manufacturing that appeared to be associated primarily with the strength of domestic demand but to some extent also with increased demand from some developing countries with regard to developments in key expenditure sectors of the economy the members anticipated that growth in consumer spending would retain considerable upward momentum given their expectations of favorable fundamentals such as further expansion in employment and incomes the rise in financial wealth that had continued through the first quarter and ready access to consumer credit some also referred to the currently elevated level of consumer

high although consumer spending had continued to advance growth in business fixed investment appeared to have slowed the housing sector showed some further signs of improvement albeit from a depressed level consumer price inflation had been subdued despite recent increases in the prices of some key commodities and longer term inflation expectations had remained stable regarding the economic outlook participants generally agreed that the pace of the economic recovery would likely remain moderate over coming quarters but would pick up over the 2013 15 period in the near term the drought in the midwest was expected to weigh on economic growth moreover participants observed that the pace of economic recovery would likely continue to be held down for some time by persistent headwinds including continued weakness in the housing market ongoing household sector deleveraging still tight credit conditions for some households and businesses and fiscal consolidation at all levels of government many participants also noted that a high level of uncertainty regarding the european fiscal and banking crisis and the outlook for u s fiscal and regulatory policies was weighing on confidence thereby restraining household and business spending however others questioned the role of uncertainty about policy as a factor constraining aggregate demand in addition participants still saw significant downside risks to the outlook for economic growth prominent among these risks were a possible intensification of strains in the euro zone with potential spillovers to u s financial markets and institutions and thus to the broader u s economy a larger than expected u s fiscal tightening and the possibility of a further slowdown in global economic growth a few participants however mentioned

242,1999-08-24,minutes,july nonetheless year over year changes in some measures of nominal compensation continued to decline at its meeting on june 29 30 1999 the FOMC adopted a directive that called for a slight tightening of conditions in reserve markets consistent with an increase of ¼ percentage point in the federal funds rate to an average of around 5 percent the members noted at that meeting that there were few current indications of rising inflation nonetheless with financial markets and foreign economies recovering since the FOMC had eased policy last fall the persisting strength of demand was enough to put added pressure over time on already very tight labor markets and at some point lead to a pickup in inflation that could threaten the sustainability of the economy s expansion because there was substantial uncertainty relating to the extent and timing of prospective inflationary pressures and thus the possibility that further firming of policy might not be needed in the very near term the directive did not contain any bias relating to the direction of possible adjustments to policy in the intermeeting period open market operations immediately after the meeting were directed toward implementing the desired slightly greater pressure on reserve positions and the federal funds rate averaged very close to the FOMC s 5 percent target over the intermeeting period treasury coupon yields fell early in the intermeeting interval as market participants apparently adjusted downward their expectations regarding further monetary tightening in response to the generally unexpected move to a neutral directive and subsequently the receipt of favorable data on inflation yields later retraced their declines however in reaction to the semi annual monetary policy report and the chairman s associated testimony and to the release of data indicating an acceleration of labor costs growing signs of a firming of activity abroad and a weaker dollar on net most interest rates were about unchanged over the intermeeting interval key measures of share prices in equity markets buoyed early in the period by lower interest rates and better than anticipated quarterly

244,2017-03-15,minutes,to project that inflation would increase gradually over this period as food and energy prices along with the prices of non energy imports were expected to begin steadily rising this year however inflation was projected to be slightly below the FOMC s longer run objective of 2 percent in 2019 the staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real gdp growth the unemployment rate and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years the risks to the forecast for real gdp were seen as tilted to the downside primarily reflecting the staff s assessment that monetary policy appeared to be better positioned to respond to large positive shocks to the economic outlook than substantial adverse ones however the staff viewed the risks to the forecast as less pronounced than in the recent past reflecting both somewhat diminished risks to the foreign outlook and an increase in u s consumer and business confidence over recent months consistent with the downside risks to aggregate demand the staff viewed the risks to its outlook for the unemployment rate as tilted to the upside the risks to the projection for inflation were seen as roughly balanced the downside risks from the possibility that longer term inflation expectations may have edged down or that the dollar could appreciate substantially further were seen as roughly counterbalanced by the upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to continue operating above its longer run potential participants views on current conditions and the economic outlook in conjunction with this fomc meeting members of the board of governors and federal reserve bank presidents submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real output

anticipate that the growth of real gdp would pick up somewhat in the second half of 2013 and strengthen further thereafter factors cited as likely to support a pickup in economic activity included highly accommodative monetary policy improving credit availability receding effects of fiscal restraint continued strength in housing and auto sales and improvements in household and business balance

recent increases in mortgage rates higher oil prices slow growth in key u s export markets and the possibility that fiscal restraint might not lessen consumer spending continued to advance but spending on items other than motor vehicles was relatively soft recent high readings on consumer confidence and boosts to household wealth from increased equity and real estate prices suggested that consumer spending would gather momentum in the second half of the year however a few participants expressed concern that higher household wealth might not translate into greater consumer spending cautioning that household income growth remained slow that households might not treat the additions to wealth arising from recent equity price increases as lasting or that households scope to extract housing equity for the purpose of increasing their expenditures was less than in the past the housing sector continued to pick up as indicated by increases in house prices low inventories of homes for sale and strong demand for construction while recent mortgage rate increases might serve to restrain housing activity several participants expressed confidence that the housing recovery would be resilient in the face of the higher rates variously citing pent up housing demand banks increasing willingness to make mortgage loans strong consumer confidence still low real interest rates and

support more vigorous expansion in economic activity in their comments about prospective developments in the major components of aggregate demand members anticipated that the household sector would remain the mainstay of the expansion and that it would be significantly reinforced going forward by an acceleration in business expenditures and at least over the next several quarters by substantial further increases in federal government spending some softening in motor vehicle sales from the exceptional pace in recent months seemed likely but overall consumer spending probably would be sustained at a high level by further anticipated gains in disposable incomes bolstered by the stimulus from recent federal tax cuts a potential negative in this outlook was the possibility that weakness in employment if it continued would at some point exert a more pronounced negative effect on consumer sentiment in the housing area residential sales and construction stayed at elevated levels during the summer months with at least some portion of the strength reportedly stemming from efforts by many homebuyers to move ahead of further increases in mortgage interest rates the run up

255,1995-07-06,minutes,fairly robust construction of multifamily housing in many areas with regard to the outlook for fiscal policy members gave considerable emphasis to recent developments in congress which suggested that there could be greater deficit reduction over the years ahead than had been built into many forecasts the direct effects of deficit cutbacks would tend to hold down the growth in final demand and act as a restraining influence on overall economic activity over the projection horizon but those cutbacks also would have favorable effects on financial markets thereby stimulating to an extent offsetting increases in spending over the longer run deficit reduction should enhance the performance and growth of the economy though monetary policy makers would need to carefully monitor possible transition effects a considerable downside risk in the view of many members was the outlook for exports economic activity in the major foreign industrial nations had been more sluggish than anticipated during the first half of the year and this raised questions about the strength of the expansion in those countries and the related prospects for the faster growth in u s exports most of the major economies in latin america also were projected to strengthen and indeed such expectations were reflected in financial markets but substantial problems remained that could undermine the favorable outlook on the positive side members observed that u s exports were now quite competitive in world markets as evidenced by continuing gains in exports to numerous countries and such a perception was reinforced by anecdotal reports of increasing foreign sales of a variety of products by firms around the country on balance some growth in exports remained a reasonable prospect but it might fall below current expectations the members generally agreed that the inflation risks in the economy had diminished though some still saw the potential for little or no progress in unwinding the recent uptick in inflation many referred to indications of easing pressures on resources in recent months and they generally felt that such pressures would be contained over the projection horizon if economic growth were to materialize in line with their forecasts developments seen as consistent with such an expectation included persisting anecdotal reports of highly competitive markets that made it very difficult for business firms to pass on cost increases or to raise profit margins moreover despite continuing reports of labor scarcities in some areas and

relatively good growth after a period of adjustment of capital stocks to more desirable levels a projected recovery in the growth of foreign economies was seen as providing increased support for u s exports and fiscal policy was assumed to become more expansionary in the FOMC s discussion of current and prospective economic developments members commented that the slowdown in the expansion to a now quite sluggish pace was likely to be more prolonged than they had anticipated earlier and indeed with the economy displaying some signs of fragility and inventories still appearing excessive in some sectors it was not entirely clear that the slowing in the growth of the economy had bottomed out despite the crosscurrents and uncertainties that were involved members saw an upturn in the economic expansion by later in the year as the most likely outlook this view was premised in large measure on the lagged effects of the FOMC s relatively aggressive easing actions this year including any further easing that might be adopted at this meeting growing prospects of some fiscal policy stimulus later in the year and more generally the favorable effects of still substantial productivity gains on profit opportunities and income growth and hence on business and household demands for goods and services as business profits stabilized and final demand firmed inventory liquidation would come to an end adding to the upward momentum of economic activity the members were uncertain as to the degree and timing of the strengthening in final demand and although a relatively prompt and strong rebound could not be ruled out many saw a variety of factors that pointed to the possibility that the upturn could be weaker or more delayed than the central tendencies of their expectations with regard to the outlook for inflation a number of members expressed concern about a tendency for some measures of inflation to edge higher this year but many members expected that the easing of

from around the nation pointed to some slowing in the growth of economic activity from a very rapid pace during the spring the extent of the slowing remained uncertain and it was unclear at this juncture whether the expansion would slow sufficiently to contain pressures on labor and other producer resources nonetheless broad measures of price inflation adjusted to exclude their volatile food and energy components did not exhibit any uptrend despite robust growth in economic activity this year and high levels of resource use indeed some price measures suggested that inflation had trended lower through the second quarter moreover there were no early signs of pressures or imbalances in the industrial sector in labor markets however there were increasing indications of tightness that might at some point feed through to greater inflation upward wage adjustments were becoming more evident and increases in overall compensation had edged up suggesting the possibility of further increases in labor costs at current or higher levels of labor utilization even before taking account of the effects of the rise in the minimum wage although increases in compensation might be

discussion of the household sector most participants noted that the data on spending were somewhat encouraging particularly with regard to spending on automobiles other consumer durables and housing several participants stated that the moderate acceleration in spending might in part reflect pent up demand following years of deleveraging and was importantly supported by the stance of monetary policy which has reduced the cost of financing purchases and improved credit availability to some degree a couple of participants noted that the increase in the payroll tax appeared to have not yet had a material effect on household spending however another suggested that the payroll tax increase along with higher gasoline prices may be one reason why spending by lower income households appeared to be depressed as those changes disproportionately cut into the disposable income of those households a couple of other participants thought that overall consumer spending was likely still held back at least in part by ongoing concerns about future income and employment prospects both fiscal restraint and the high level of student debt were mentioned as risks to aggregate household spending over the forecast period participants generally saw conditions in the housing market as having improved further over the intermeeting period rising house prices were strengthening household balance sheets by raising wealth and by increasing the ability of some homeowners to refinance their mortgages at lower rates such a dynamic was seen as potentially leading to a virtuous cycle that could help support household spending and financial market conditions over time reports from homebuilders in many parts of the country were encouraging one participant pointed to ongoing changes in a range of factors including demographics credit conditions business models and consumer preferences that were likely shifting both supply and demand in the housing sector and concluded that the outlook for the sector was quite uncertain and potentially subject to rapid changes many participants reported that their business contacts were seeing some further improvement in the economic outlook firms reported

activity over the closing months of 1996 was persisting in 1997 some observed that it was difficult to detect signs of weakness or imbalances in domestic sectors of the economy while the members believed that some slowing in the expansion was inevitable they felt that substantial uncertainty surrounded the timing and extent of such slowing in the quarters ahead continued growth near or even somewhat below the recent pace would raise resource utilization rates further from their already high levels although labor markets already were tight inflation had remained relatively subdued and there were no signs in price data that it was picking up however the risks of a rise in inflation down the road had increased appreciably as a result of the strength of aggregate demand and the increase in pressures on resources that likely would accompany it absent a firming in financial conditions in their discussion of the outlook for spending in key sectors of the economy members emphasized the strength of consumer spending in recent months they noted that anecdotal reports from numerous parts of the country and surveys indicating very high levels of consumer confidence tended to confirm statistical evidence of an ebullient consumer sector while the recent surge in consumer demand probably was supported mainly by rapid growth in employment and labor income it seemed possible that consumers also were responding increasingly to the run up in household net worth stemming from the earlier buoyant performance of the stock market the effects of rising financial wealth on consumer spending were difficult to isolate and they were undoubtedly restrained by efforts to accumulate savings for future expenditures such as college expenses and retirement moreover the constraints on spending imposed by the high debt burdens of many households tended to exert at least a partly offsetting influence on overall consumer spending on balance however the members believed that the consumer sector was likely to provide major ongoing support to the expansion though the increases in consumer spending probably would diminish in the context of more restrained growth in jobs and incomes a number of members expressed the view however that the risks to such a forecast were in the direction of more robust consumer spending business fixed investment which had remained on a

282,1997-08-19,minutes,first half of the year in 1998 the economy would expand at a pace in line with the growth of its estimated potential growth of consumer spending supported by high levels of household wealth and projected further gains in employment and income was expected to be relatively brisk over the forecast horizon business spending on equipment and structures was anticipated to continue to outpace the overall expansion of the economy though the differential would tend to narrow over time in association with the gradual diminution of increases in sales and profits that was expected in conjunction with moderating economic growth housing construction was projected to drift lower over the forecast horizon the staff anticipated that the external sector would exert some mild restraint on the expansion of economic activity with labor compensation gradually accelerating in the context of higher resource utilization core consumer price inflation was forecast to drift slightly higher the FOMC s discussion of current and prospective economic developments highlighted statistical and anecdotal evidence of a solid economic performance including indications of a rebound in final demand after a lull during the spring and the persistence of relatively subdued and by some measures declining inflation growth in consumer spending had slowed sharply and a surge in inventory accumulation had accounted for much of the expansion of economic activity in the second quarter looking ahead the members did not believe that recent developments had altered the prospect that the economy would settle into a pattern of moderate growth approximating its potential such a forecast was subject to considerable uncertainty and several members observed that the risks appeared to be mostly in the direction of stronger growth in demand with regard to the outlook for inflation widespread evidence of very tight labor markets was associated with scattered indications that the rise in labor compensation might be accelerating but overall labor costs had remained relatively damped and price inflation restrained gains in productivity and muted increases in nonlabor costs probably also were contributing to holding producer costs under good control nonetheless the members remained concerned about the risks of rising inflation especially if somewhat faster than projected growth in economic activity were to occur and add to pressures on resources in an economy that already seemed to be operating close to or perhaps even above its sustainable potential the uncertain

287,2018-09-26,minutes,real gdp growth this year was revised up a little primarily in response to stronger than expected incoming data on household spending and business investment the projection for the medium term was not materially changed in part because the recently enacted tariffs on chinese goods and the retaliatory actions of china were judged to have only a small net effect on u s real gdp growth over the next few years in addition the staff continued to anticipate that supply constraints might restrain output growth somewhat in the medium term the unemployment rate was projected to be a little lower over the medium term than in the previous forecast partly in response to the staff s assessment that the natural rate of unemployment was a bit lower than previously assumed with labor market conditions already tight the staff continued to assume that projected employment gains would manifest in smaller than usual downward pressure on the unemployment rate and in larger than usual upward pressure on the labor force participation rate the staff forecast for total pce price inflation in 2018 was revised up slightly mainly because of a faster than expected increase in consumer energy prices in the second half the staff continued to project that total pce inflation would remain near the FOMC s 2 percent objective over the medium term and that core pce price inflation would run slightly higher than total inflation over that period because of a projected decline in consumer energy prices in 2019 through 2021 the staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real gdp growth the unemployment rate and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years the staff also saw the risks to the forecasts for real gdp growth and the unemployment rate as balanced on the upside household spending and business investment could expand faster than the staff projected supported in part by the tax cuts enacted last year on the down side trade policies and foreign economic developments could move in directions that have significant negative effects on u s economic growth risks to the inflation projection also were seen as balanced the upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to move further above its potential was counterbalanced by the downside risk that longer term inflation

290,1994-08-16,minutes,would continue to be damped by the higher mortgage rates however the pace of homebuilding was expected to remain relatively robust compared with the rate of recent years reflecting still unsatisfied demand for homeownership and the relatively favorable cash flow affordability of housing as judged by the standards of the past two decades the restraint on economic activity exerted by weak export demand was projected to diminish as economic conditions improved abroad given the competitiveness of u s produced goods in the FOMC s discussion of current and prospective economic developments members commented that final aggregate demand appeared to have slowed somewhat in recent months but that the expansion still seemed to have considerable underlying momentum indeed available data on the various components of spending taken together might in fact be understating the growth in economic activity the strength of labor markets and measures of gross domestic income suggested a somewhat stronger economic performance sustained expansion perhaps at a pace broadly in line with or a bit above the economy s long run growth potential remained a reasonable expectation but many members observed that they saw the risks as being on the upside of such a projection in the absence of some further policy tightening views varied to some degree with regard to available margins of unemployed resources but the members agreed that the economy probably was operating very close to and in the view of some might have reached its long run potential in these circumstances the members saw appreciable risks of intensifying pressures on resources and higher inflation broad measures of wages and prices suggested little change in inflation trends in recent quarters but worrisome signs of greater inflation were evident in the prices of materials purchased by business firms and in anecdotal reports of successful efforts by an increasing number of businesses to pass on rising costs by raising prices in their comments on business conditions in different parts of the nation members reported continuing expansion ranging from modest to solid growth in most regions however the rise in business activity appeared to have slowed in some areas and business conditions had remained essentially unchanged in a number of others notably in california in

funding from the additional longer term repo operations spanning year end and increased capacity in daily operations as helping to maintain stable conditions in short term funding markets in addition market participants prepared earlier than usual for year end with borrowers increasing their term borrowing from private lenders and lenders apparently expanding their lending capacity since year end money market rates remained stable with the desk s longer term repos maturing with no discernible effect on market conditions and reserve management purchases of treasury bills proceeding smoothly at the current pace of 60 billion per month the staff s estimates suggested that after april of this year the desk s reserve management purchases will restore the permanent base of reserves to levels above those prevailing in early september 2019 al though reserves are projected to be above 1 5 trillion before april a surge in the treasury general account balance during the april tax season is expected to briefly reduce reserve levels and in the absence of repo operations bring reserves down temporarily to around 1 5 trillion the manager discussed a potential plan for gradually transitioning to an operational approach designed to maintain ample reserve levels without the active use of repo operations to supply reserves under this plan repo operations would be maintained at least through april to ensure ample reserve conditions however the desk would continue the gradual reduction and consolidation of its repo offerings ahead of april with the plan of phasing out term repo operations after april as part of this transition the minimum bid rate on repo operations could be gradually lifted and the FOMC could consider whether there is a role for repo operations in the implementation framework in the second quarter the manager expected reserve conditions to support slowing the pace of treasury bill purchases with the goal of eventually aligning growth of the federal reserve s treasury holdings with trend growth in its liabilities as that time approaches the FOMC might wish to consider the appropriate maturity composition of reserve management purchases of

outlook the central bank of brazil reduced its policy rate after having raised it several times earlier this year in contrast china continued to tighten its monetary policy extending reserve

since the time of the previous forecast as investors pulled back from riskier assets nevertheless the staff continued to forecast that economic activity would increase more rapidly in the second half of this year than over the first half as supply chain disruptions in the motor vehicle sector eased in the medium term the staff still projected real gdp to accelerate gradually supported by accommodative monetary policy further increases in credit availability and improvements in consumer and business confidence from their current low levels the increase in real gdp was expected to be

of the trend growth in output in their review of developments in different parts of the country and sectors of the economy members referred to indications of continuing growth in regional business activity ranging from relatively modest to quite robust across much of the nation at the same time some areas such as california continued to experience generally stagnant economic conditions while solid growth seemed to characterize the overall economy the members saw increasing signs of some slowing in many areas business and consumer sentiment generally remained quite positive although a number of members commented on a new note of caution among some of their business contacts and some shaving of industry forecasts for the balance of the year turning to the key consumer sector members commented on various indications of some moderation in the growth of expenditures higher interest costs were cited by some business contacts as constraining purchases of consumer durables but members also referred to the negative impact of persisting highly visible cutbacks in workforces by some major business firms and of growing consumer debt some members also noted that supply constraints such as limitations on the availability of some popular automobile models had tended to curb the expansion in sales looking ahead more moderate growth in consumer spending seemed likely apart from the direct effects of higher interest rates on such spending the prospectively less ebullient housing sector was likely to retard demands for household furnishings business fixed investment was thought likely to continue to provide appreciable stimulus to the expansion though to a diminishing extent in the context of slower overall growth in economic activity and higher financing costs while

information indicated that economic activity had appreciably more forward momentum than previously perceived and that inflation pressures could be intensifying while underlying inflation appeared to have moved up only modestly and nearly all participants thought that core and total inflation going forward would be relatively low they had become less certain of that outlook for the next few

aggregate demand the staff viewed the risks to its outlook for the unemployment rate as tilted to the upside participants views on current conditions and the economic outlook in their discussion of the economic situation and the outlook meeting participants saw the information received over the intermeeting period as suggesting that economic activity had been expanding moderately household

private domestic final demand expanding at a solid pace participants generally viewed the incoming data as confirming their assessment that economic activity would continue to expand at a moderate rate leading to further improvement in labor market conditions however some participants were concerned that the recent slowdown in employment growth might prove more than temporary and that

countries the dollar was also little changed against an index of the currencies of other important u s trading partners m2 grew rapidly in february owing mainly to robust inflows to liquid deposits earlier filings for tax refunds and hefty mortgage prepayments associated with refinancing activity likely were factors in the strength of m2 in addition investors might have seen liquid deposits as a safe haven at a time of considerable volatility in equity markets the staff forecast prepared for this meeting continued to suggest that economic expansion would be muted for a time faced with the likely onset of war in the very near term and the large uncertainties relating to its aftermath businesses and consumers were likely to hold down their spending in addition continued sluggish economic growth among most major u s trading partners was expected to damp u s exports nonetheless those restraining influences were expected to abate over time the considerable monetary ease already in place

significant impetus to spending inventory overhangs had been largely eliminated and business capital stocks had moved closer to desired levels as a consequence a slowly improving outlook for sales and

sales remained strong the available information from district business contacts was generally consistent with the recent trend in data on spending although a couple of reports noted that households were spending cautiously and that some price discounting was likely over the coming year participants expected consumer outlays to be supported importantly by ongoing gains in jobs rising income and improved household balance sheets in addition several participants pointed out that low energy costs should help support consumer expenditures the housing market was recovering gradually with single family homebuilding continuing to trend up and multifamily construction remaining at a high level the reports on the pace of construction and real estate activity across districts varied nonetheless several participants noted factors pointing to continued improvement in the housing sector including ongoing house price appreciation low levels of home inventories the substantial gap between the rate of household formation and the relatively slow pace of construction and the possibility that homebuyers may be entering the market in anticipation of higher mortgage rates outside of the residential sector commercial building was highlighted as an area of relative strength in a few districts as a result of the recently passed bipartisan budget act federal spending was expected to

benefit from the reduced uncertainty about the federal fiscal outlook business activity was solid outside of sectors adversely affected by low energy prices and weak exports a number of participants commented on the strength in the services sector in their districts citing in particular activity in high tech transportation leisure and hospitality and health related businesses some reported that the stronger manufacturing industries in their districts included aerospace power generation equipment and medical equipment and that the domestic auto industry was still a bright spot however

313,2017-05-03,minutes,measured by changes in the pce price index was revised down marginally for 2017 as a whole after incorporating the soft data on consumer prices for march but it was essentially unrevised thereafter inflation was still expected to be somewhat higher this year than last year reflecting an upturn in the prices for food and non energy imports as well as a slightly faster increase in energy prices the staff continued to project that inflation would increase gradually in 2018 and 2019 and that it would be marginally below the FOMC s longer run objective of 2 percent in 2019 the staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real gdp growth the unemployment rate and inflation as similar to the average of the past 20 years the risks to the forecast for real gdp were seen as tilted to the downside primarily reflecting the staff s assessment that monetary policy appeared to be better positioned to respond to large positive shocks to the economic outlook than to substantial adverse ones however the staff viewed the risks to the forecast as less pronounced than late last year with both somewhat diminished risks to the foreign outlook and an increase in u s consumer and business confidence consistent with the downside risks to aggregate demand the staff viewed the risks to its outlook for the unemployment rate as tilted to the upside the risks to the projection for inflation were judged to be roughly balanced the downside risks from the possibility that longer term inflation expectations may have edged down or that the dollar could appreciate substantially were seen as roughly counterbalanced by the upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was projected to continue operating above its longer run

sectors of the domestic economy members saw little reason to anticipate substantial slowing in the growth of consumer or business expenditures in coming quarters and they also expected housing activity to be maintained at a relatively high level the recent further increases in equity prices from already high levels played an important role in the assessments of several members the stock market s rise was viewed as somewhat puzzling given indications of some slowing in the growth of profits and the potential for earnings disappointments as the expansion in spending moderated and profit margins narrowed in the context of more rapid labor cost increases so long as a high degree of optimism in the stock market persisted however the elevated level of financial wealth and the low cost of capital should continue to boost spending consumer expenditures especially for durable goods had risen sharply thus far this year and the factors that had fueled that expansion were still unusually positive they included large increases in employment and personal incomes the continuing uptrend in financial wealth relative to disposable income and in these circumstances the persistence of a very high level of consumer confidence attractive financing conditions and favorable business confidence also were expected to support substantial further growth in business investment especially in high tech equipment that was characterized by rapid product improvement and falling prices investment in nonresidential structures notably in office and other commercial markets seemed likely to strengthen somewhat in response to reduced vacancy rates and sizable increases in rents in many areas indeed several members again reported indications of speculative nonresidential construction in

economic activity had been expanding moderately despite the global economic and financial developments of recent months household spending had been increasing at a moderate rate and the housing sector had improved further however business fixed investment and net exports had been soft a range of labor market indicators including strong employment growth and rising labor force participation pointed to a further strengthening of the labor market participants generally saw the data on economic activity and labor market conditions as broadly consistent with their earlier expectations inflation picked up in recent months but it continued to run below the FOMC s 2 percent longer run objective market based measures of inflation compensation remained low while survey based measures of longer

reduction in their risk taking financial conditions deteriorated with equity prices falling and credit spreads on riskier corporate bonds widening subsequently investor sentiment rebounded and domestic and global financial conditions eased on net over the intermeeting period with respect to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market participants shared the assessment that with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy real gdp would continue to increase at a moderate rate over the medium term and labor market indicators would continue to strengthen participants observed that strong job gains in recent months had reduced concerns about a possible slowing of progress in the labor market many participants however anticipated that relative strength in household spending would be partially offset by weakness in net exports associated with lackluster foreign growth and the appreciation of the dollar since mid 2014 in addition business fixed investment seemed likely to remain sluggish furthermore participants generally saw global economic and financial developments as continuing to pose risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market in the united states in particular several participants expressed the view that the underlying factors abroad that led to a sharp though temporary deterioration in global financial conditions earlier this

greece and to lower the interest rates on those loans the european central bank ecb left its benchmark policy rate unchanged at its march meeting but the emphasis on upside risks to inflation at the postmeeting press conference led market participants to infer that the ecb might well tighten policy at its meeting in april in the united kingdom market based readings on expected policy rates indicated that investors anticipated some tightening of policy before the end of this year in addition authorities in several emerging market economies took steps to tighten policy the broad nominal index of the u s dollar declined about 1 percent on balance over the intermeeting period staff economic outlook the pace of economic activity appeared to have been a little slower around the turn of the year than the staff had anticipated at the time of the january fomc meeting and the near term forecast for growth of real gross domestic product gdp was revised down modestly however the outlook for economic activity over the medium term was broadly similar to the projection prepared for the january fomc meeting changes to the conditioning assumptions underlying the staff projection were mostly small and offsetting crude oil prices had risen sharply and federal fiscal policy seemed likely to be marginally more restrictive than the staff had judged in january but these negative factors were counterbalanced by higher household net worth and a slightly lower foreign exchange value of the dollar as a result as in the january forecast real gdp was expected to rise at a moderate pace over 2011 and 2012 supported by accommodative monetary policy increasing credit availability and greater household and business confidence reflecting the recent labor market data the projection for the unemployment rate was lower throughout the forecast period than in the staff s january forecast but the jobless rate was still expected to decline slowly and to remain elevated at the end of 2012 the staff revised up its projection for consumer price inflation in the near term largely because of the recent increases in the prices of energy and food however in light of the projected persistence

declines in energy and import prices dissipated and the labor market strengthened further participants generally saw the risks stemming from global economic and financial developments as having diminished over the intermeeting period but as continuing to warrant close monitoring participants indicated that their assessments of the medium term economic outlook had not changed materially since march and discussed a number of factors suggesting that the apparent softness in spending in the first quarter was unlikely to persist most pointed to the steady improvement in the labor market as an indicator that the underlying pace of economic activity had likely not deteriorated as much as was suggested by the recent data on spending and production notably solid job gains and real income growth along with a high level of household wealth and relatively upbeat consumer sentiment were expected to support a pickup in consumer spending after its slowdown in the first quarter in addition the easing of financial conditions in recent months was anticipated to provide some support for consumer spending and business investment going forward many also thought that as had apparently been the case in recent years a low reading on seasonally adjusted first quarter gdp growth could partly reflect measurement problems and if so would likely be followed by stronger gdp growth in subsequent quarters however some participants were concerned that transitory factors may not fully explain the softness in consumer spending or the broad based declines in business investment in recent months they saw a risk that a more persistent slowdown in economic growth might be under way which could hinder further improvement in labor market conditions participants generally agreed that the risks to the economic outlook posed by global economic and financial developments had receded over the intermeeting period the public appeared to have interpreted federal reserve communications following the march fomc meeting as indicating that achieving the FOMC s economic objectives would likely require a somewhat more gradual pace of increases in the federal funds rate than anticipated earlier the

expected appeared to prompt a downward shift in investors expected path for the federal funds rate later in the intermeeting period growing apprehension that turmoil in markets for subprime mortgages

measures of long horizon inflation compensation based on inflation indexed treasury securities edged down financial market conditions were volatile during the intermeeting period particularly over the

liquid deposits and retail money market mutual funds were little changed on net over these two months despite the recent slow growth of m2 its velocity remained low relative to the level that would be

for this meeting the staff raised its projection for economic growth over the remainder of 2005 in light of incoming data suggesting greater near term momentum in aggregate demand at the same time however it trimmed the growth rate forecast for 2006 reflecting the effects of higher energy prices higher long term interest rates and the somewhat slower growth of productive capacity implied by the annual revisions to the national accounts the output gap was predicted to be essentially closed by the end of this year inventory investment was projected to resume contributing to gdp growth over the

before falling back in the fourth quarter with housing starts essentially flat residential investment was projected to decelerate substantially over the remainder of this year business investment was predicted to continue to rise at a moderate pace benefiting from still accommodative financial conditions and the ongoing need to replace depreciating equipment and software the recent improvement in the trade balance was expected to be transitory notwithstanding recent benign readings on inflation the forecast for core pce inflation was raised somewhat owing in part to the recent further rise in

341,2008-06-25,minutes,foreign exchange value of the dollar against major currencies rose m2 rose much more slowly in april and may than in the first quarter the deceleration seemed to reflect primarily an unwinding of heightened demand for the relative safety and liquidity of money market mutual funds that had boosted m2 in prior months in the forecast prepared for the meeting the staff raised its projection for the growth of real gross domestic product gdp for 2008 the available indicators of spending particularly those for consumption and business investment suggested that economic activity in the first half of the year had been somewhat firmer than previously expected the staff projection prepared for the meeting pointed to modest expansion in real gdp in the first half of 2008 followed by a slight slowdown in growth in the second half when several factors were likely to restrain spending including lower household wealth slower real income growth due to sharply higher oil prices and tight credit conditions the pace of economic activity was projected to pick up in 2009 as those effects waned and weakness in housing construction abated despite this acceleration the trajectory of economic growth anticipated through 2009 implied noticeable slack in resource utilization the staff s projection for price inflation in core personal consumption expenditures pce for 2008 as a whole was unchanged recent readings on core pce inflation were better than anticipated and led the staff to lower its projection for the first half of the year but some of the recent improvement was seen as reflecting transitory factors and the forecast of core inflation for the second half of this year and next year was marked up to incorporate the likely pass through of the recent jumps in the prices of energy and other commodities and the reversal of these transitory factors the further large increase in energy prices also prompted an upward revision of the forecast of headline pce inflation in the second half of 2008 and headline inflation was expected to exceed core inflation by a considerable margin this year however in view of a projected leveling out of energy prices and the anticipated slack in resource utilization headline inflation was expected to decline considerably in 2009 from its pace in the second half of 2008 and core inflation was forecasted to

forecast prepared for this meeting continued to suggest that the expansion would gradually moderate from its currently elevated pace to a rate around or perhaps a little below the growth of the

the growth of real gdp in the fourth quarter of 2005 seemed largely to have reflected temporary or special factors economic growth had rebounded strongly in the first quarter but seemed likely to moderate to a more sustainable pace as yet the run up in the prices of energy and other commodities appeared to have had only a modest effect on core inflation ongoing productivity gains had helped to hold the growth of unit labor costs in check and inflation expectations had remained contained still the FOMC noted that possible increases in resource utilization in combination with the elevated prices of energy and other commodities had the potential to add to inflation pressures in these circumstances the FOMC judged that some further policy firming may be needed to keep the risks to the attainment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability roughly in balance but reiterated that in any event the FOMC would respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to foster these objectives investors anticipated the fomc s decision at its march meeting to raise the target federal funds rate 25 basis points but the FOMC s post meeting statement evidently led them to mark up somewhat their expected path for the federal funds rate subsequently the path was pushed up further by data releases that were on balance stronger than market participants had expected speeches by

349,1999-05-18,minutes,in the economy s estimated potential growth of private final demand would be damped by the anticipated waning of positive wealth effects stemming from large increases in equity prices and by slower growth of spending on consumer durables houses and business equipment after the earlier buildup in the stocks of these items the lagged effects of the rise that had occurred in the foreign exchange value of the dollar were expected to place continuing though diminishing restraint on the demand for u s exports for some period ahead labor markets were anticipated to remain tight and inflation was projected to increase somewhat on balance over the projection period partly as a result of some firming of import prices that in turn would give domestic firms somewhat more leeway to raise their prices in the FOMC s discussion of current and prospective economic developments members commented that they saw few signs of any moderation in the expansion of economic activity from the rapid pace that had prevailed in recent quarters a pace greater than the growth in the economy s potential even though the growth of potential was rising as a result of accelerating productivity for a number of reasons they still viewed some slowing in the expansion to a growth rate more in line with that of potential as a reasonable expectation however the timing and extent of the moderation remained subject to substantial uncertainty and in light of the persistent strength in domestic demand the reduced risks of economic weakness abroad and the recovery in u s financial markets most members believed that for the year ahead the odds around their forecasts were tilted toward further robust growth that would add to pressures on already tight labor markets the latest statistical and anecdotal information on wages and prices while somewhat more mixed than earlier continued on balance to present a picture of benign inflation however the firming of oil and other commodity prices the more frequent anecdotal reports of increases in some costs and prices and the most recent cpi statistics could be read as suggesting at least that the trend toward lower inflation

somewhat their estimates of economic growth in late 2013 as well as their assessments of likely growth in the first quarter of 2014 had not prompted a significant revision of their projections of moderate economic growth over coming quarters most participants noted that unusually severe winter weather had held down economic activity during the early months of the year business contacts in various parts of the country reported a number of weather induced disruptions including reduced manufacturing activity due to lost workdays interruptions to supply chains of inputs and delivery of final products and lower than expected retail sales participants expected economic activity to pick up as the weather related disruptions to spending and production dissipated a few participants however highlighted factors other than weather that had likely contributed to the slowdown during the first quarter including slower growth in net exports following its unusually large positive contribution to growth in the fourth quarter of 2013 moreover it was noted that some of the pickup in economic growth that had appeared to have been indicated by the data available at the january meeting had been reversed by subsequent data revisions for many participants the outlook for economic activity over coming quarters had changed little on balance since the time of the december meeting housing activity remained slow over the intermeeting period although unfavorable weather had contributed to the recent disappointing performance of housing a few participants suggested that last year s rise in mortgage interest rates might have produced a larger than expected reduction in home sales in addition it was noted that the return of house prices to more normal levels could be damping the pace of the housing recovery and that home affordability has been reduced for some prospective buyers slackening demand from institutional investors was cited as another factor behind the decline in home sales nonetheless the underlying fundamentals including population growth and household formation were viewed as pointing to a continuing recovery of the housing market in their discussion of

356,2014-03-19,statement,economy to support ongoing improvement in labor market conditions in light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions since the inception of the current asset purchase program the FOMC decided to make a further measured reduction in the pace of its asset purchases beginning in april the FOMC will add to its holdings of agency mortgage backed securities at a pace of 25 billion per month rather than 30 billion per month and will add to its holdings of longer term treasury securities at a pace of 30 billion per month rather than 35 billion per month the FOMC is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities in agency mortgage backed securities and of rolling over maturing treasury securities at auction the FOMC s sizable and still increasing holdings of longer term securities should maintain downward pressure on longer term interest rates support mortgage markets and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation over time is at the rate most consistent with the FOMC s dual mandate the FOMC will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months and will continue its purchases of treasury and agency mortgage backed securities and employ its other policy tools as appropriate until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability if incoming information broadly supports the FOMC s expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its

staff s forecast of potential output growth the staff however had again reduced its projection for potential gdp growth and the projected slow pace of growth over the next several quarters was thus

historic range at least on the basis of current estimates and was unlikely to decline significantly if at all much would depend on consumers outlook for employment and incomes growing demands should eventually be translated into faster employment gains but at this point business firms continued to resist adding to their workforces despite increasing sales and many firms were still announcing workforce reductions while net gains in employment including growth associated with increases in self employment and new business formations were continuing expansion in jobs and consumer incomes probably would be at a moderate pace over the year ahead against this background members generally expected moderate growth in consumer spending to be maintained but they did not see such spending as likely to give extra impetus to growth in economic activity in 1994 the members anticipated appreciable further expansion in business investment spending especially in the context of reduced interest rates improved business balance sheets and ongoing efforts to improve productivity growth in spending for business equipment probably would continue at a relatively vigorous pace though perhaps somewhat below the growth rates experienced in recent quarters and other investment activity seemed poised to pick up in this connection several members reported that vacancy rates in commercial office buildings were declining in some areas and while this development was not yet being translated into appreciable new construction investment funds appeared to be flowing more freely into commercial real estate clear indications of strengthening were observed in housing construction in many parts of the country and the outlook for such building activity seemed promising in the context of reduced mortgage rates and improving consumer sentiment fiscal policy developments including the effects on business attitudes of the uncertainties surrounding health care reform legislation were likely to continue to inhibit the expansion over the year ahead some members again emphasized the negative effects that the ongoing retrenchment in defense spending was having on local economies as well as on the economy more generally on the taxation side the rise in tax liabilities on higher incomes could have an especially pronounced effect during the early months of next year given the

366,1994-11-15,minutes,effect thus far on this typically interest sensitive sector of the economy one reason it was suggested was the apparent willingness of some homebuyers to accept higher mortgage rates at this point because they expected rates to rise further later even so the members continued to anticipate some slowdown in housing construction over coming quarters overall construction activity was likely to be supported to some extent however by further gradual gains in nonresidential construction notably commercial and industrial structures and perhaps some continuing strength in multifamily housing after a surge in the second quarter inventory investment remained substantial in the third quarter and appeared to be continuing at a robust pace in the current quarter for a variety of reasons inventory accumulation might well be relatively brisk for some period of time given the favorable sales experience of numerous business firms and the still quite low levels of inventories relative to sales moreover with capacity pressures in many industries leading to some lengthening in delivery times businesses would tend to build inventories to support sales and avoid disruptions to production schedules tending to confirm such an assessment were anecdotal reports suggesting that recent additions to inventories were largely intended and not the result of disappointing sales an inventory buildup at the pace recorded on average in the second and third quarters would not be sustainable but inventory investment was likely to be relatively well maintained over coming months if aggregate demand were to expand in line with current expectations the members generally anticipated that the external sector of the economy would provide some impetus to the expansion the recent depreciation of the dollar and strength in foreign economic activity could be expected to boost real exports at a time when growth in real imports was likely to moderate the resulting improvement in the nation s net trade position would however tend to exacerbate any tendency for domestic demand to outrun the economy s output potential in the FOMC s discussion of the outlook for prices the members saw considerable potential for higher inflation if growth in demand and output continued at an unsustainable pace placing added pressures on labor and other producer resources they noted indications of greater inflation pressures especially in the rising prices of many materials used in the production process and the increasing number of reports of labor shortages to date prices of finished goods and services,demands anticipated slowing growth employment consumer incomes members also noted rising interest rates likely damp consumer spending notably durable

369,1994-12-20,minutes,of favorable consumer sentiment that in turn undoubtedly reflected the rapid growth in employment and income it was still too early to form reliable estimates of retail sales in the current holiday season the anecdotal reports pointed to seasonal increases ranging from moderate to strong in various regions but some members emphasized that sales volumes were being buttressed by unusual promotional efforts including relatively large discounts some members also commented that consumer debt was growing rapidly and that increased debt levels were likely to exert a retarding effect on consumer spending especially if consumer loan rates were to be adjusted more fully upward to reflect increases in market interest rates rates on adjustable home mortgages were moving higher to catch up with market rates and these increases along with the wealth effects from losses suffered on bond and stock holdings were likely to damp spending up to now however the members saw few signs of any moderation in the growth of consumer spending including little apparent effect from somewhat higher interest rates on normally interest sensitive spending for motor vehicles and other consumer durables business fixed investment which was contributing substantially to the current strength of the expansion was likely to remain a positive factor in sustaining the overall growth of the economy during the year ahead even so as the expansion matured and growth in final demand tended to moderate business investment could be expected to soften as in the case of consumer spending however there were few signs of any slowing in the current data or anecdotal reports indeed members saw growing indications of some improvement in nonresidential construction activity as brisk economic expansion tended to absorb increasing amounts of previously vacant commercial and industrial space and prices of such facilities tended to firm in the homebuilding sector the latest available data did not indicate any weakening in housing construction despite the rise in mortgage interest rates however anecdotal reports from different parts of the country suggested that the single family sector might be weakening at the same time construction of multifamily units continued to exhibit strength in a number of areas and this sector appeared to be on a gradual uptrend as falling vacancy rates brought

activity in the short run nonetheless the members continued to anticipate a strengthening as the year progressed and during 2002 fostered to a large extent by the lagged effects on spending of the substantial easing in monetary policy since early this year the stimulus from recently enacted tax cuts and the positive effects on household and business purchasing power of some recent reductions in energy prices in addition the abatement and eventual turnaround of the downward adjustments to capital spending and inventories would add impetus to economic growth going forward it was noted however that the unique characteristics of the current cyclical experience including the heavy concentration of weakness in business expenditures and manufacturing output increased the uncertainty that surrounded any forecast most of the members believed that the risks to the expansion notably for the nearer term remained to the downside of current forecasts potential sources of shortfalls included the effects of possible further increases in unemployment on consumer and business confidence the risks of disappointing business earnings that could damp investment and through lower equity prices consumption and the growing indications of weakness in foreign economies that could limit demand for exports in an environment of diminished pressures in product and labor markets and of lower energy costs members commented that price pressures were likely to remain contained at least over the near to intermediate term in preparation for the mid year monetary policy report to congress the members of the board of governors and the presidents of the federal reserve banks provided individual projections of the growth of gdp the rate of unemployment and the rate of inflation for the years 2001 and

372,2000-12-19,minutes,to continue its moderate expansionary trend core price inflation was projected to rise only slightly over the forecast horizon partly as a result of higher import prices but also as a consequence of some further increases in nominal labor compensation gains that would not be fully offset by the expected growth of productivity in the FOMC s discussion of current and prospective economic developments members commented that recent statistical and anecdotal information provided clear indications of significant slowing in the expansion of business activity and also pointed to appreciable erosion in business and consumer confidence the deceleration in the economy had occurred from an unsustainably high growth rate in the first half of the year and the resulting containment in demand pressures on resources already had improved the outlook for inflation the question at this juncture was whether the expansion would remain near its recent pace or continue to moderate while the former still seemed to be the most likely outcome the very recent information on labor markets sales and production business and consumer confidence developments in financial markets and growth in foreign economies suggested that the risks to the economy had shifted rapidly and perceptibly to the downside concerning the outlook for inflation members commented that the upside risks clearly had diminished in the wake of recent developments and that with pressures on resources likely to abate at least a little subdued inflation was a reasonable prospect weakening trends in production and employment were most apparent in the manufacturing sector there were widespread anecdotal reports of production cutbacks notably in industries related to motor vehicles and of associated declines in manufacturing employment however many of the factory workers losing their jobs were readily finding employment elsewhere in what generally continued to be characterized as very tight labor markets across the country the softening in manufacturing reflected weak sales and prompt efforts to limit unwanted buildups in inventories even so business contacts reported currently undesired levels of inventories in a range of industries not only in motor vehicles in the aggregate cutbacks in inventory investment or runoffs of existing inventories accounted for a significant part of the recent moderation in the growth of the overall economy the slowing in the growth of consumer spending that had prompted much of the backup in inventories was evident from a wide variety of information including anecdotal reports from various parts of the country,spending recent months perhaps persisting effects rise opportunity costs earlier year m3 growth slowed less m2 november part

intermeeting period as indicating that economic activity was expanding moderately although net exports remained soft household spending and business fixed investment were increasing moderately and the housing sector recovered further the labor market continued to improve with solid job gains and declining unemployment and labor market indicators showed that underutilization of labor resources had diminished since early in the year growth in real gdp over the first half of the year was stronger than participants expected when they prepared their june forecasts and the unemployment rate declined somewhat more than anticipated participants made only small adjustments to their projections for economic activity over the medium term they continued to anticipate that with appropriate policy accommodation the pace of expansion of real activity would remain somewhat above its longer run rate over the next two years and lead to further improvement in labor market conditions most continued to see the risks to real activity and unemployment as nearly balanced but many acknowledged that recent global economic and financial developments may have increased the downside risks to economic activity somewhat inflation continued to run below the FOMC s longer run objective partly reflecting declines in energy prices and in prices of non energy imports market based measures of inflation compensation moved lower survey measures of longer term inflation expectations remained stable participants anticipated that recent global developments would likely put further downward pressure on inflation in the near term compared with their previous forecasts more now saw the risks to inflation as tilted to the downside but participants still expected that as the labor market continued to improve and the transitory effects of declines in energy and non oil import prices dissipated inflation would rise gradually toward 2 percent over the medium term consumer spending was rising at a solid rate after a modest increase in the first quarter participants noted that ongoing gains in employment and real income were providing support for the rise in spending and this support was expected to continue going forward household credit performance was also favorable with delinquency rates on credit cards and auto loans low the available reports from district contacts in the retail

spending but one that would be offset to a degree by the difficulties of an increasing number of households in servicing their growing debts the greater affordability of housing stemming from the earlier decline in mortgage rates was projected to help sustain homebuilding activity at a relatively high level in the context of reduced growth in sales and profits business investment in new equipment and structures was projected to increase more moderately after several years of rapid advance although indications of excess inventories were limited slower growth in sales and ongoing efforts to reduce inventory costs were projected to lead to smaller increases in stocks over the projection period exports were expected to be bolstered to some extent by the projected improvement in the economies of major trading partners although a great deal of uncertainty still surrounded the fiscal outlook the forecast continued to incorporate an appreciable degree of fiscal restraint given the projected outlook rates of utilization of labor and capital resources would remain relatively high and the underlying trend of price inflation was seen as unlikely to change significantly over the projection period in the FOMC s discussion of current and prospective developments members noted that the information that had become available since the november meeting tended to confirm earlier indications that the economic expansion had slowed appreciably from the brisk pace of the summer months the members generally agreed that the most likely course for the economy remained one of moderate growth expansion at or near potential was seen as the most probable outcome associated at least in part with the favorable effects on business and consumer spending of lower interest rates higher equity prices and an ample availability of credit however a number of members expressed concern that the strength of final demands would not be sufficient to support growth near the economy s potential absent a policy adjustment one factor that might retard growth was a higher level of real short term interest rates owing to the favorable performance of inflation members noted that

reduced interest rates in intermediate and long term debt markets the improved balance sheets of consumers and businesses and the indications of a somewhat better availability of loans from financial intermediaries in an environment of moderate economic growth the fundamentals bearing on the outlook for inflation were consistent with further disinflation and the members drew some encouragement from consumer and producer price developments in recent months several cautioned however that recent price measures probably overstated the reduction in inflation just as the surge in prices earlier in the year seemed to have overstated the underlying inflation trend members also referred to the persistence of inflationary expectations among business executives and consumers thus while the rise in inflation appeared to have been arrested any further progress toward price stability was likely to be limited over the quarters ahead business contacts and other sources of information suggested little change since the july meeting in the pace or composition of economic activity in different parts of the country descriptions of economic performance varied from slow to moderate growth in most regions though business activity probably continued to weaken in some major areas such as california despite sustained if not ebullient growth in sales to consumers and the relative strength in business investment spending in the first half of this year business sentiment was widely described as cautious or negative even in some regions whose economies were outperforming the nation as a whole according to business contacts the recent enactment of deficit reduction legislation had tended to mitigate concerns about the size of future federal deficits but business executives were now focusing on the implications of higher taxes and many were expressing apprehension about further though still unannounced tax increases that might be associated with health care reform business

business capital goods pressures on labor resources were likely to ease slightly as the expansion of economic activity moderated but inflation was projected to rise noticeably over the year ahead largely in association with a partial reversal of the decline in energy prices this year in the FOMC s discussion of current and prospective economic conditions members commented that moderate growth at a pace close to the economy s potential remained a reasonable expectation for the year ahead the members recognized however that such a projection was subject to an unusually wide range of uncertainty in both directions on the upside they emphasized the marked resilience and persisting strength of private domestic demand which had kept the economy expanding at a faster pace than most had anticipated in addition members commented that domestic financial conditions including the rebound in stock market prices currently were supportive of further expansion in aggregate demand and in that regard several noted the continued rapid growth of the broad monetary aggregates still domestic financial markets remained unusually sensitive and subject to relatively pronounced adjustments to unanticipated developments that could have substantial effects on confidence and economic activity the external sector continued to represent a major source of downside risk the economies of several industrial countries seemed to be weakening and the outlook for several key emerging market economies remained in doubt with a further loss of confidence and contagion from the latter a continuing threat with regard to the outlook for inflation members reported that labor markets were extraordinarily tight across the nation but they saw only limited evidence of accelerating wage increases and

cash flow affordability of home ownership business spending on equipment and structures was projected to grow less rapidly in light of the anticipated moderate growth of sales and profits on balance the external sector was expected to exert a small restraining influence on economic activity over the projection period a slight degree of fiscal restraint was anticipated over the forecast horizon continued pressure on resources especially in labor markets pointed to a likely underlying tendency toward higher inflation over the projection period however it was expected that improved supply conditions in food and energy markets as well as planned technical changes would damp increases in the consumer price index relative to the elevated 1996 rate in the FOMC s discussion members commented that most recent developments bearing on the outlook for economic growth and inflation had been favorable the information on economic activity since the september meeting had confirmed earlier indications of appreciable slowing in the expansion to a sustainable pace close to the economy s potential the outlook remained subject as usual to considerable uncertainty but many of the members observed that underlying trends in key sectors of the economy along with generally supportive financial conditions seemed consistent with further moderate economic expansion in this regard several focused on what they saw as the promising prospects for a rebound in the growth of consumer expenditures following weak expansion in the third quarter the pickup would help sustain moderate economic growth over the nearer term despite some anticipated retrenchment in inventory accumulation with respect to the outlook for inflation members emphasized that despite widespread indications of tight labor markets the increase in wages had been muted and somewhat less than anticipated and there was no broad evidence of rising price inflation indeed many major measures of inflation had exhibited a slight downtrend since 1993 looking ahead views differed to some extent regarding the most likely course for inflation several members indicated that while recent developments were

bond markets were expected to provide underlying support for aggregate demand later in the year and in 1996 the forecast continued to anticipate that consumer spending would be restrained by smaller gains in real incomes and the satisfaction of pent up demands for motor vehicles and other durable goods business outlays for new equipment were expected to decelerate substantially in response to the slower growth of sales and profits homebuilding was projected to pick up somewhat in lagged response to the recent decline in mortgage rates developments in mexico might depress u s exports further but mainly in the very near term given the size of the adjustments already evident in the mexican current account with this influence waning sustained growth in the economies of other u s trading partners was expected to boost export demand considerable uncertainty continued to surround the fiscal outlook but the forecast maintained the greater degree of fiscal restraint that had been assumed since early in the year in the staff s judgment the prospects for some easing of pressures on resources suggested that price inflation would likely moderate from its recently higher level in the FOMC s discussion of current and prospective economic conditions members reported on statistical and anecdotal indications of further slowing in the expansion of economic activity and some related easing of pressures on labor and other producer resources a number commented that they anticipated a relatively sluggish economic performance over coming months as production was cut back to bring inventories into better balance with sales however underlying demand was likely to remain sufficiently robust especially in light of developments in financial markets to avert a cumulative decline in business activity and indeed to return economic growth to a pace broadly in line with potential members cited in particular the strength in business fixed investment and the potential for improvement in housing activity and the trade balance as factors that should help to sustain the expansion nonetheless the longer run outlook remained subject to considerable uncertainty especially given the

reduced its estimate of the increase in real gdp in the first quarter and marked up its forecast of the rebound in economic activity in the second quarter in large part because of a more substantial swing in inventory investment than previously expected the revisions however left the projection of economic growth over the first half of the year unchanged as was the case in may economic activity was expected to increase at a rate a little below that of the economy s long run potential for the remainder of the year and to rise at a pace broadly in line with potential output growth in 2008 the

assuming no changes from current financial conditions the individual members saw likely prospects for expansion over the forecast horizon at a pace close to or a little above the estimated growth of the economy s long run potential many noted however that high levels of consumer and business confidence and supportive financial conditions among other factors suggested the possibility that growth could turn out to be even faster with the utilization of productive resources notably labor already at particularly high levels in relation to the economy s potential an outcome no stronger than current forecasts could well have adverse implications for inflation nonetheless the members also noted that the rise in compensation increases had been damped and that there continued to be few indications of accelerating price inflation in the statistical and anecdotal information available at this time such developments underlined persisting uncertainties about behavior in labor markets and the level and growth of the economy s sustainable potential in their review of developments in key sectors of the economy members referred to favorable underlying factors in the outlook for consumer spending these included solid growth in consumer incomes large increases in financial wealth and currently high levels of consumer confidence while more moderate growth in consumer spending for durable goods seemed likely after an extended period of robust expansion these favorable factors suggested that the risks of a different outcome were tilted in the direction of faster than projected expansion on the negative side large consumer debts were still viewed as likely to constitute an inhibiting influence on consumer expenditures and many banking institutions had tightened lending terms and conditions at least for their more marginal consumer borrowers on balance growth in consumer expenditures at a somewhat reduced pace approximating that of the expected expansion of disposable incomes appeared to be a reasonable prospect though one that was subject to considerable uncertainty spending for business fixed investment seemed to have retained a good deal of momentum even after the large increases in such expenditures in recent years clearly businesses regarded such investments as highly profitable and they appeared to be leading to gains in productivity that in

that they saw a basis in this development for mild optimism about the outlook for inflation but others expressed concern that in the context of current forecasts for economic activity and relatively high levels of resource use progress toward lower inflation was unlikely over the projection period and indeed there was a risk of some modest deterioration in price performance in the course of the FOMC s discussion members reported on uneven business conditions in different parts of the country and among industries on balance modest to moderate growth appeared to characterize most regions with overall levels of activity ranging from relatively robust in some regions to comparatively depressed in others the mixed conditions were especially notable in manufacturing where numerous producers faced lagging demands while others particularly in high tech industries found it difficult to satisfy strong demands for their products more generally the industrial sector of the economy had tended to stagnate for some time including a slight decline in manufacturing activity reported for october but recent improvement in orders for steel was cited as a favorable if not decisive omen in the outlook for industrial production in other sectors of the economy members observed that tourism displayed considerable strength in many areas while cattle operations and energy production were adversely affected by high production costs or low prices in their review of developments in key demand sectors of the economy members observed that consumer spending appeared to be on a firm growth trend though weakness in overall sales of motor vehicles in recent months and a decline in total retail sales in october had introduced a cautionary note it was suggested that the performance of retail sales during the holiday season would tend to set the tone for the longer term trend in such sales and in this respect available data and anecdotal reports covering the first part of november were somewhat promising more generally further growth in consumer spending though probably at a somewhat slower pace than over the past year appeared likely such growth would be supported by moderate

393,1998-08-18,minutes,markets and an upward tilt in the rise of labor compensation for the present however inflation remained subdued and it was likely to remain relatively low for some time in light of the weakness in commodity and other import prices and the tendency for low current inflation to hold down expected price increases among the factors bearing on the outlook for domestic economic activity the members viewed the external sector as a major source of uncertainty the continued rapid decline in net exports during the first half of the year largely seemed to reflect the further financial unsettlement and a deeper contraction in asian economies than had been anticipated earlier and several members commented that they saw little evidence that financial and economic conditions in asia were stabilizing indeed such conditions appeared to be worsening further in some asian nations and other countries had been affected by the associated weakening in the demand for commodities and the more risk averse attitudes of investors anecdotal reports at this meeting suggested that the impact on the domestic economy was being felt by manufacturing firms in several industries although some firms also reported that declining exports to asia were being offset at least in part by rising exports to other areas of the world looking ahead the members agreed that the duration and extent of disruptions in asian and other economies could not be anticipated with any degree of confidence while net exports were not expected to decline as rapidly as they had in the first half of the year even more serious disruptions in asia could not be ruled out and would have important implications for the u s economy in their review of developments in key expenditure sectors of the domestic economy members observed that over the first half of the year the strength in domestic final demand notably in the consumer and business investment sectors had more than offset the negative effects of developments in the foreign sector and other factors in the consumer sector the outlook for further sizable increases in spending was buttressed by unusually favorable underlying factors including solid ongoing gains in employment and incomes and substantial further increases in household net worth this year a pause in the robust gains in retail sales in early summer was accounted for in part

in aerospace and defense related industries nonresidential construction activity including commercial and industrial building and infrastructure construction displayed signs of considerable strength in some parts of the country and declining vacancy rates pointed to a leveling out or even a pickup in nonresidential building construction in a number of other areas some expansion in inventories seemed likely over the forecast horizon to accommodate the continuing growth in overall demands in this connection members noted that a rise in inventories probably contributed to the expansion in production in recent months since the latter could not be explained entirely by the strength of final demand and a buildup of motor vehicle stocks in late 1993 was likely to continue into the early part of 1994 the housing sector was expected to remain a source of considerable economic stimulus during the early months of 1994 both directly and indirectly in terms of the favorable effects on purchases of home furnishings some members commented that the increases in housing starts experienced over the closing months of this year might not be sustainable even so housing construction especially in the single family sector should be relatively well maintained given the likelihood that home ownership would remain comparatively affordable in the context of growing incomes favorable mortgage rates and limited pressures on the prices of new homes with respect to fiscal policy members referred to the prospects for further cutbacks in defense spending that probably would continue to be offset only in part by growth in federal government purchases of other goods and services however net reductions in government purchases were expected to diminish over the projection horizon likewise adverse effects on spending of the rise in tax rates on higher incomes would tend to be concentrated in the first half of 1994 and the impact on spending over the months ahead might well be relatively limited because many taxpayers probably had anticipated the higher taxes and had taken measures to mitigate or spread out their effects or would meet new tax obligations partly out of

outlook for economic activity rates of utilization of labor and capital were not expected to change materially and inflation was projected to increase modestly in the FOMC s discussion of current and prospective economic developments members commented on the resiliency of the economy which appeared to have strengthened appreciably after a period of subpar growth the latter had been induced to a large extent by inventory adjustments whose effects were exacerbated temporarily by government shutdowns unusually severe winter weather and industrial strikes the adjustment in inventory investment seemed to be nearing its completion and some members observed that the settlement of the recent strike in the motor vehicle industry might well impart added impetus to the expansion over the nearer term considerable volatility could be expected in the short run performance of the economy but the members continued to view trend growth at a pace near the economy s potential as the most probable outcome many also commented that the risks to such a forecast appeared to have shifted from being predominantly on the downside earlier in the year to better balanced currently still substantial uncertainties attended the economic outlook and a number of members observed that an economic performance that differed considerably in either direction from their current forecasts might well materialize over the projection period regarding the outlook for inflation members assessments tended to center on expectations of little change in average consumer price inflation over the projection horizon the review of regional economic developments by the federal reserve bank presidents pointed to moderate expansion in economic activity across much of the nation though growth was described as modest in a few regions and relatively robust in some others business conditions appeared to have improved in a number of areas since early in the year but as had been true previously activity in

countries were likely to continue to limit u s exports which had declined since the end of 1992 indeed available data supplemented by reports from a variety of contacts suggested that business conditions had remained quite weak or had worsened in a number of foreign industrial nations even so business contacts in some parts of the united states indicated that foreign demand for their products was still quite robust business activity abroad which already was trending higher in a few industrial nations was viewed as likely to strengthen more generally over the year ahead with positive effects on overall u s exports turning to the outlook for inflation members commented that despite favorable readings recently a wide range of price and wage data had suggested some acceleration in the rate of inflation during the early months of the year to some extent the indications of intensified inflation might have been the result of difficulties with seasonal adjustments or other temporary factors but there were reports of some successful efforts by business firms to raise prices following the spurt in demand and the rise in capacity utilization toward the end of 1992 these price developments were disappointing and suggested to many members that the disinflationary trend might have been arrested at least for now though the economic fundamentals remained consistent with a resumption of some further downward movement in the rate of inflation with regard to those fundamentals many members saw significant albeit diminished slack in labor and product markets as likely to persist over the forecast horizon given their current forecasts of moderate expansion in economic activity other favorable factors in the inflation outlook included efforts by businesses to hold down costs and increase productivity by restructuring their operations and investing in new more productive equipment unfortunately these favorable elements in the underlying economic situation

and expected further weakness in net exports needed to be weighed against the favorable effects on interest sensitive spending of considerably reduced intermediate and long term interest rates and the much improved financial condition of many business firms and households with regard to the outlook for inflation some members suggested that the prospects for continued slack in resource utilization were consistent with a disinflationary trend but the disparate factors bearing on the outlook for inflation as well as the swings in price performance experienced in recent quarters argued for caution in assessing the future course of inflation in their review of developments around the nation members commented that business conditions remained uneven across local areas and industries but they

the military and civil service within the government and office jobs more generally in addition regulations aimed at correcting some problems in financial institutions such as real estate appraisal and downpayment requirements were having unintended adverse effects on lower income businesses and households and other proposals aimed at promoting minority lending were in danger of promising more

states than previously had been anticipated exports to many asian countries and possibly to other u s trading partners whose economies might be adversely affected by the spillover effects of developments in asia would be reduced and declines in import prices would ease inflation pressures however the ultimate extent of the adjustment in asian economies remained unknown and more substantial downward pressure on the economies of the united states and its trading partners could not be ruled out with regard to the prospects for final demand in key sectors the members noted that the appreciation of the dollar against a wide range of currencies along with the prospective slackening in world economic expansion associated with the asian turmoil could be expected to exert a considerable damping effect on u s exports over the next several quarters in addition increased uncertainty about financial asset values possibly related in part to further difficulties in asia could lead to greater caution in spending while a substantial decline in equity values should it occur would have a more pronounced effect by reducing household wealth and raising the cost of equity capital however a number of members suggested that consumer spending might hold up relatively well if the effects of the asian crisis on the u s economy were not markedly deeper or more prolonged than currently expected to date anecdotal reports indicated only scattered signs of weaker export demand primarily some slackening in orders for and shipments of selected commodities such as agricultural goods and lumber and wood products and there were few indications of reduced demand for manufactured goods at the same time business contacts were optimistic about holiday sales tourism was booming in

that could increase pressures on resources with adverse implications for inflation in an economy already operating in the neighborhood of its estimated long term potential moreover faster increases in energy and food prices could contribute to higher overall inflation both directly and by boosting inflationary expectations and the proposed increase in the minimum wage would add to cost pressures if it were enacted into law nonetheless while the chances of a pickup in inflation later had risen to some extent a number of members emphasized that no firm evidence had surfaced thus far to signal that labor compensation was increasing at a faster rate or that core inflation was worsening and even the early signs of increased pressures on costs and prices were mixed the last few years had witnessed significantly lower cost pressures and more subdued inflation than typically would have been experienced in earlier years with similar rates of resource utilization but whether this favorable outcome would persist was an open question members observed that the stronger than expected performance of the economy thus far this year reflected relatively rapid growth in final demand favorable financial conditions notably the relatively low interest rates of the latter part of 1995 and early 1996 and increases in wealth stemming from sizable advances in stock market prices evidently were undergirding the expansion indications of improving or continuing high levels of economic activity were widespread across the nation according to recent anecdotal reports and regional data though agricultural conditions in many areas were cited as a significant exception while the economy appeared to have solid and balanced momentum that pointed to sustained growth a number of factors were seen as likely
