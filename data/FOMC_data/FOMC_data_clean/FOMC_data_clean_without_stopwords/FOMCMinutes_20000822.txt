spring factors contributing recent reductions included economic data releases viewed balance confirming earlier indications demand growth slowing sustainable pace price pressures would remain damped

notably equipment software projected remain robust solid economic growth abroad expected boost expansion u exports period ahead core consumer price inflation projected rise somewhat forecast horizon part result higher import prices largely consequence increases nominal labor compensation gains would fully offset growth productivity committee discussion current prospective economic conditions members agreed information available since midyear provided increased evidence growth aggregate demand aggregate supply coming closer balance statistical evidence reviewed committee supported widespread anecdotal reports pointed noticeable slowing expansion demand economic activity slowdown led moderation consumer spending decline housing expenditures occurring even full effects earlier tightening financial conditions felt time apparent continued acceleration underlying productivity boosting economy potential output growth context leveling broadest measures equity prices year without full feedback demand previous accelerations prices rising somewhat year ago pickup seemed reflect direct indirect effects higher energy prices increase productivity growth kept unit labor costs well contained despite rapid gains compensation developments much improved prospects sustainable economic expansion prevailing stance monetary policy even members anticipated labor markets would remain exceptionally tight labor compensation already accelerating higher energy prices potentially raising inflation expectations agreed risks remained weighted toward rising inflation committee discussion outlook economy members focused considerable attention growth rate economy supply potential ability satisfy growth demand sustainable basis widespread application technological advances associated surge outlays capital equipment fostering acceleration labor productivity seemed ongoing data productivity capital accumulation become available recent months tended confirm trends statistical evidence reinforced comments many business executives persistent upward revisions long term profit forecasts yet suggest leveling productivity growth quickening productivity fundamental factor behind economy remarkable performance recent years members noted however historical episodes involving major changes productivity trends rare past therefore provided limited basis evaluating course future productivity developments accordingly considerable caution needed exercised assessing outlook productivity relying projections economy prices necessarily embodied judgments outlook making monetary policy another source uncertainty related interactions rising productivity aggregate demand course recent years accelerating productivity gains tended boost aggregate demand even potential aggregate supply owing effects stronger profits investment spending rising stock market consumption well however leveling stock prices year suggested recent increases productivity growth built market expectations prices time ago likely provide impetus demand going forward past productivity acceleration members cautioned nonetheless possibility long term interest rates equity prices yet adequately reflect ongoing productivity gains could ruled attendant effects boosting demand finally rising productivity clearly major force containing inflation period unusually low unemployment rates interactions productivity growth wages prices could adduced interactions involved complex processes difficult assess given paucity prior experience consequence judgments labor market pressures productivity inflation viewed care basis evolving developments review outlook expenditures key sectors economy members observed growth consumer spending moderated substantially period exceptional gains late 1999 early 2000 clearest evidence softening consumer demand tended concentrated sales motor vehicles housing related durable goods available data reduced growth consumer spending supported anecdotal reports slippage retail sales expectations several parts country factors underlying developments included diminishing wealth effects several months limited changes equity prices cumulative

going forward members noted consumer confidence remained high level consumer incomes rising anecdotal evidence pointed marked deterioration consumer spending would pose potential threat sustainability economic expansion housing sector provided clearest indication response aggregate demand firming interest rates affecting industries producing construction materials household furnishings anecdotal reports much country tended confirm statistical evidence downward trend housing starts home sales factors helping explain softness housing included rise occurred mortgage interest rates reported

sharp contrast developments consumer housing sectors business outlays capital equipment software continued rise exceptional rates even several years rapid growth persistence dramatic expansion evidently reflected expectations capital investments would continue earn high rates return although extraordinary rates increase investment outlays currently displayed little sign abating historical patterns indicated even dramatic surges shifts technology invariably lost momentum new technology widely adopted rates return investments tended diminish reliable way anticipate timing downturn indeed little reason expect turnaround nearer term current investment boom members noted however investment outlook nonresidential construction sector presented much mixed picture business investment continued exhibit considerable vigor many areas clearly weakened others nation whole seemed poised relatively subdued advance coming quarters one factor pointing latter direction evidence cautious attitudes part many business executives especially lending institutions strengthening economies many u trading partners fostering rising demand u exports trend seemed likely persist according reports many domestic business contacts nonetheless nation current account deficit apparently continued increase development members expressed concern view risks posed foreign exchange value dollar domestic inflation time still experience last years clearly demonstrated dollar likely remain strong long foreign investors continued see attractive investment opportunities united states past experience also suggested international capital flows quickly reverse timing major turnaround dollar could predicted degree confidence committee discussion outlook inflation members noted overall measures price inflation picked fairly high levels standards recent years largely result higher energy costs moreover supply factors major energy markets petroleum gas electricity generating capacity point significant relief considerable period time still core consumer price indices remained relatively damped risen little last year especially measured pce chain price index suggested underlying price pressures remained largely contained nonetheless number members concerned unusually taut labor markets could begin point show increases labor compensation excess productivity gains pressuring unit costs prices evidence yet emerge perhaps productivity continued accelerate flattening rate increase productivity even high level could well pose point risk continued favorable inflation performance sure number positive factors outlook inflation including highly competitive conditions many markets stable relatively favorable expectations regard longer run inflation outlook signs remarkable acceleration productivity continuing balance however members saw mild upward trend key measures inflation distinct possibility albeit one subject considerable uncertainty committee discussion policy intermeeting period ahead members endorsed proposal retain current stance policy consistent federal funds rate continuing average 6 1 2 percent assessment factors leading decision members focused evidence moderating demand accelerating productivity closing gap growth aggregate demand potential supply even earlier committee tightening actions exerted full restraining effects recent rally

inflation intensify materially especially nearer term statement intended express views longer term horizon agreed risks lay direction price acceleration risks higher inflation time seen importantly stem unusually taut conditions labor markets could place upward pressures unit costs prices especially productivity growth leveled future members also cited potential persistently higher energy prices affect longer run inflation expectations possibility taking consideration recent declines long term interest rates financial conditions might yet tight enough balance aggregate demand potential supply
