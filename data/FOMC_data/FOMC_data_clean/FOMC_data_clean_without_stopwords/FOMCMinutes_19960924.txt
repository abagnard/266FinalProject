assess moderation expansion final demand recent months together still relatively robust growth employment production suggested inventory investment picked since second quarter strength inventories july tended confirm assessment however assuming moderate economic growth line current forecasts reason anticipate substantial strengthening inventory investment coming quarters indeed recent rebuilding inventories little growth earlier year made rapid expansion less likely going forward members acknowledged nonetheless inventory developments needed monitored care including indirect signs rising pressures prices intermediate goods tightening delivery schedules might provide incentives rapid buildup capacity utilization already high levels relatively rapid growth inventory investment superimposed stronger projected expansion final demand could portend serious pressures resources inflationary consequences economy comments outlook inflation members observed recent behavior price inflation welcome though highly unusual development given current pressures resources statistical anecdotal information provided evidence increasingly tight labor markets similar conditions historically associated considerable upward pressure nominal labor compensation turn prices wages probably total labor compensation rising rapidly year acceleration latter still appeared held worker insecurity relatively subdued increases cost benefits moreover variety reasons rising labor costs currently passed prices several key measures adjusted volatile food energy components exhibited steady even declining trend explanations tended concentrate intense competition many markets prevented firms raising prices absorb cost increases return top competitive pressures also compelling firms curb cost increases improvements productivity performance widespread reports suggested major gains productivity numerous industries induced recent years business restructuring related activities large capital investments introduced increasingly productive equipment although currently available measures productivity economy whole showed weak gains sectoral disaggregation data gave reasons question productivity measurements productivity increased fairly sharply manufacturing slowdown overall productivity since 1973 concentrated service areas economy indeed measured productivity noncorporate businesses largely services displayed negative trend many years result implausible suggested considerable error estimating output prices many services consequently likely actual productivity growth higher current measures indicated token rate price inflation lower reported consistent findings number studies distortions published price data implications inflation outlook clear cut key question long favorable price behavior would persist advances productivity boosted profit margins high margins helpful could absorb portion cost increases time however many business contacts indicated would resist squeezes profit margins continued acceleration costs would eventually feed greater price inflation whatever rate productivity growth behavior costs ability businesses pass along greater increases time would depend extent expansion would slow much associated pressure would labor product markets connection members observed even expansion slow sustained pace around rate increase economy potential price inflation could well trend least modestly higher current levels resource utilization others disagree odds might tilted marginally direction continued believe great deal uncertainty

steady course await developments expansion appeared slowing substantially broad measures prices adjusted fluctuations food energy components still indicated steady even slightly declining inflation trend circumstances committee could wait information momentum expansion degree pressure resources implications inflation delay adjusting monetary policy facilitated current positioning appear far desirable longer term stance pickup inflation likely relatively small gradual supported possibility excessive reaction financial markets change direction policy members indicated could vote slight tightening policy although feel urgency move observed decision close one light uncertainties involved willing join majority wait evidence bearing outlook inflation regard possible intermeeting adjustments policy members agreed retaining asymmetric directive biased toward restraint would consistent assessments inflation risks economy accordingly information suggesting odds higher inflation risen met prompt policy firming differing view focused desirability prompt move toward restraint curb seen growing inflationary pressures economy tight labor markets likely exert continuing upward pressure labor costs barring unexpected weakness economy point costs would begin passed prices circumstances important policy forward looking move promptly head intensifying inflationary pressures potentially waiting could require disruptive policy tightening actions later could risk credibility system anti inflation policy return top conclusion committee discussion one members indicated could
