for immediate release share the FOMC decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 4 3 4 percent the slowing of the growth of real gdp in the fourth quarter of 2005 seems largely to have reflected temporary or special factors economic growth has rebounded strongly in the current quarter but appears likely to moderate to a more sustainable pace as yet the run up in the prices of energy and other commodities appears to have had only a modest effect on core inflation ongoing productivity gains have helped to hold the growth of unit labor costs in check and inflation expectations remain contained still possible increases in resource utilization in combination with the elevated prices of energy and other commodities have the potential to add to inflation pressures the FOMC judges that some further policy firming may be needed to keep the risks to the attainment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability roughly in balance in any event the FOMC will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to foster these objectives
