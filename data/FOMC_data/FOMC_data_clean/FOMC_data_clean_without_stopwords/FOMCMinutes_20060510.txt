gdp increasing around 5 percent annual rate although expansion appeared likely moderate evidently remained solid inflation pressures appeared somewhat greater committee anticipated time march meeting consumer prices recently risen pace noticeably average rise previous twelve months also prices energy many commodities climbed sharply late inflation expectations appeared risen slightly economic growth continued moderate coming quarters anticipated pressures productive resources would likely continue limited participants expected allowing possible near term volatility related recent jump energy commodity prices core inflation would probably remain around levels experienced average past year however recent developments suggested upside risks inflation risen somewhat since time march meeting discussion major sectors economy participants noted growth household spending likely slow remainder year anecdotal information pointed cooling housing markets cooling especially noticeable high end homes houses markets previously experienced steepest appreciation data home sales permits starts whole likewise suggested activity gradually diminishing reports indicated speculative building homes dropped considerably inventories unsold homes still seemed expanding although fresh comprehensive data available home prices average appeared still rising slower pace past years going forward growth consumption spending likely supported gains employment personal income slower appreciation home prices effects increases energy prices interest rates already occurred would likely act restrain

increase federal receipts entirely clear robust income growth probably important factor case effect trim current federal budget deficit noticeably nonetheless longer run federal fiscal imbalance remained serious concern data economic growth outside united states indicated global expansion firming sense amplified reports international contacts apparent strengthening global growth likely support u exports economic activity would also tend maintain upward pressures energy commodity prices meeting participants expressed concern recent price developments implications inflation prospects core consumer inflation lately little higher expected moreover energy prices risen steeply period since march meeting although pass apparently limited date recent increases might reflected greater degree core inflation coming months participants noted prices non energy commodities industrial metals building supplies also climbing recent decline dollar another factor could add inflation pressures although effect prior changes foreign exchange value dollar core consumer prices apparently limited business contacts reported continued shortages certain types skilled labor related wage pressures occupations would tend boost costs however participants also cited factors could expected restrain inflation although alternative measures labor compensation provided divergent readings growth total compensation balance appeared remain moderate even nominal wages accelerate somewhat relatively wide profit margins could buffer effect prices final goods services firms would seek maintain margins recent experience suggested might accomplished part productivity gains remained fairly strong balance recent quarters rather rapid price hikes participants discussed detail inflation expectations potentially important factor influencing future inflation trends surveys suggested inflation expectations risen recent weeks others implied expectations little changed measures inflation compensation based difference yields nominal treasury securities inflation indexed issues edged higher possible though investors uncertainty regarding inflation prospects inflation expectations risen balance participants judged inflation expectations risen somewhat development would taken account policymaking warranted close monitoring remained contained although committee discussed policy approaches ranging leaving stance policy unchanged meeting increasing federal funds rate 50 basis points members believed additional 25 basis point firming policy appropriate today keep inflation rising promote sustainable economic expansion recent price developments argued another firming step today meeting core inflation recently bit higher expected several members remarked core inflation around upper end viewed acceptable range moreover number factors augmenting upside risks inflation surge energy commodity prices recent weakness foreign exchange value dollar possibility apparent increase inflation expectations could persisted impart momentum inflation addition economy appeared operating relatively high level resource utilization growing quite strongly whether economic growth would moderate sustainable pace yet clear time members also saw downside risks economic activity example cumulative effect past monetary policy actions recent rise longer term interest rates housing activity prices could turn larger expected still seemed likely modest policy action including 25 basis point firming today growth activity would moderate gradually coming quarters pressures resources would remain limited core inflation would stay close levels experienced past year given risks growth inflation committee members uncertain much tightening would needed today action view risk outlook inflation could worsen committee decided repeat indication policy statement released march meeting policy firming could required however committee agreed emphasize extent timing firming depend importantly evolution economic outlook implied incoming information members debated appropriate characterization inflation expectations statement low stable inflation expectations key attainment committee dual objectives price stability maximum sustainable economic growth however apparent pickup longer term expectations worrisome relatively small remained within range seen past couple years
