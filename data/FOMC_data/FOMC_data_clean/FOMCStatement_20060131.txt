for immediate release share the FOMC decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 4 1 2 percent although recent economic data have been uneven the expansion in economic activity appears solid core inflation has stayed relatively low in recent months and longer term inflation expectations remain contained nevertheless possible increases in resource utilization as well as elevated energy prices have the potential to add to inflation pressures the FOMC judges that some further policy firming may be needed to keep the risks to the attainment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability roughly in balance in any event the FOMC will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to foster these objectives
